In general, label only explicit requests. Do not try to interpret or infer the user's intent.
Take users at their word. If they ask specifically for experiences, then it's not information. If they ask for emotional support, then it's not experiences.
You can apply more than label to a single sentence, but don't get too caught up in labeling every possible interpretation of a sentence. Focus on the main goal of the sentence.

REMINDER: Don’t label sentence fragments!
