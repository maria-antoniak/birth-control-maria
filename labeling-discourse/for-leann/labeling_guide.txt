In general, label only explicit requests. Do not try to interpret or infer the user's intent.
Take users at their word. If they ask specifically for experiences, then it's not information. If they ask for emotional support, then it's not experiences.
You can apply more than label to a single sentence, but don't get too caught up in labeling every possible interpretation of a sentence. Focus on the main goal of the sentence.


========================================
NO LABEL  
========================================

thank yous
"bleeding after sex" (not enough information)

"Thank you guys" (not much content, not directly about birth control)
"Kyleena &amp; Lowered Arousal/Libido" (not enough information)
"Adderall for weight loss?" (not enough information)

national policies, funding, political and religious stances

“I thought I would be fine since I was on the depo so long beforehand, and didn't even realize this could possibly be a symptom of the implant.”
