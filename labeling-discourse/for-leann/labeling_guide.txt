In general, label only explicit requests. Do not try to interpret or infer the user's intent.
Take users at their word. If they ask specifically for experiences, then it's not information. If they ask for emotional support, then it's not experiences.
You can apply more than label to a single sentence, but don't get too caught up in labeling every possible interpretation of a sentence. Focus on the main goal of the sentence.


========================================
NO LABEL  
========================================

thank yous
"bleeding after sex" (not enough information)
"even after the IUD my boyfriend" (sentence fragment)
"This is so great!" no context, no connection to birth control or health (might be about the community or something else)
"Thank you guys" (not much content, not directly about birth control)
"Kyleena &amp; Lowered Arousal/Libido" (not enough information)
"Adderall for weight loss?" (not enough information)


========================================
DESCRIBING FUTURE PLANS
========================================

future plans, can be uncertain
“I’m going to my IUD inserted this afternoon.”
“I’m planning to start birth control next month.”
"I'm thinking about counting it as a missed pill and taking another one just to cover all my bases."
“I might get the implant” – ?
“I’m thinking about taking another one just to cover all my bases."


========================================
HYPOTHESIZING
========================================

conjectures, explanations, diagnoses 
needs to be about a particular person, not general explanations (which would be PROVIDING INFORMATION instead)
"I think I may have had a cyst rupture, I've had this happened before and it has been that painful."
"I know it will probably take up to six months for my body to readjust"
"I'm thinking about counting it as a missed pill” 


========================================
DESCRIBING SENSEMAKING PROCESS
========================================

mentions of reading other people's stories and comments, doing research…
“I’ve been reading all your comments.”
“After looking at all my options, I decided to start the pill.”
“I talked with my doctor about the IUD and learned that the insertion can be painful.”


========================================
META DISCUSSION
========================================

must still be related to birth control and health
rants, conversation-starters, opinions that aren’t just about personal decisions
humor, politics
"I love how sex positive all the IUD commercials are"
"Why don't doctors warn women about all these side effects?"
"How would your life be different if you stopped taking birth control?"
"While the article was interesting, I find some of its claims about the IUD weird."
"I've never heard of the mirena before"
national policies, funding, political and religious stances
"It's time for FDA to pull this thing off the market."
"Leah Barkoukis - Seattle Schools to 6th Graders: No Soda For You, But Here's An IUD"
"Why You Should Get An IUD Now, Before Trump Takes Office In January."
"birth control is the second best thing a woman can put in her mouth to prevent pregnancy" 
NOT thank you, sorry, meta-comments about the subreddit (mods, banning, rules) (not about birth control)
NOT personal attacks, comments about other people's comments ("you're being mean to OP") (not about birth control)


========================================
DISCLOSING POSITIVE EMOTIONS
========================================

expressing personal relief/happiness/satisfaction
emotions NOT opinions
"I'm excited to get this Nexplanon taken out of my arm."
"I cannot wait to get it out even though it’s also done a lot of good for me." (both positive and negative!)
NOT thank you (even if "thank you, you put my mind at ease"); it needs to be about birth control, not internet interactions
NOT general value statements (“I like the pill”) and comparisons (e.g., "The pill is the best option")
NOT just emoji or emoticons


========================================
DISCLOSING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS
========================================

sharing negative thoughts or emotions (worry, sadness, anger, fear) 
"I'm worried that it might not be working."
"I'm petrified to get this Nexplanon taken out of my arm."
"I cannot wait to get it out even though it’s also done a lot of good for me." (both positive and negative!)
"I cried like ten times yesterday."
"This experience sucks."
NOT value statements (“I hate the pill”) and comparisons (e.g., "The pill is the worst option")
NOT physical pain alone (also needs an expression of sentiment)
NOT just emoji or emoticons


========================================
DISCLOSING IDENTITY
========================================

statements about identity (age, gender, job, nationality, relationship status, etc.)
"I'm getting married next month." 
"I'm a nurse." 
"I'm 15 years old."
NOT "I prefer to keep things natural." 
NOT “I have an IUD”


========================================
DISCLOSING PREFERENCES
========================================

“I like the pill”
"The thing is, I've heard that skipping placebo pills like that can cause spotting and breakthrough bleeding and such, which I want to avoid at all costs."
“Can’t stay on BC pills, bad acid reflux, want to stick with pills”
"I began taking the combination pill (maexeni) mostly because I wanted to get rid of my period"
"I love the implant and feel like this is my only option."
“The IUD is the best choice for me.”
“I stopped the pill because it made me erratic, but weight gain would be even worse.”
“To me, taking the pill was a small price to pay to avoid having a period.”
“If I could do it again, I wouldn't get the IUD.”


========================================
SEEKING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
========================================

*explicit* requests for support
"Can someone reassure me?"
"Am I overthinking this?"
"For my peace of mind, I'd like to hear your experiences."
"No horror stories please."
NOT “I’m freaking out about my appointment tomorrow” (not an explicit request)


========================================
SEEKING INFORMATION
========================================

"How do I take the pill?"
"How does the IUD work?"
"What will happen if I ...?"
“Is it a good pill for someone who has never been on BC before?”
"Is it possible that it's gotten infected?"
"Which option is better?"
"When will it stop hurting?"
"Am I protected during my placebo week?"
"Does anyone know if the higher dose reduces bleeding?"
"Can you take vitmains with the pill?" (vs "Should I take vitamins with the pill?" --> advice)
NOT follow up questions (e.g., "Have you tried the pill?")
NOT asking for advice ("Should I take my placebo pills?")


========================================
SEEKING ADVICE
========================================

personal questions about what to do
"Should I do this or that?"
"What should I do?"
"When should I start taking my placebo pills"
"Should I take Plan B?"
"I'm getting my Mirena inserted tomorrow, do you have any advice for me?"
NOT follow up questions (e.g., "Have you tried the pill?") - these should be personal questions not questions about other people


========================================
SEEKING NORMALITY
========================================

"Is bleeding like this normal?"
"Is it normal to get my period after missing one pill?"
"Is my experience typical?"


========================================

"#News Update: Contraceptive Implant Gets Stuck In Woman And Doctors Still Can't Find It"
NOT general news, needs to be about a specific person


???
“I’m considering either the patch or the ring”

???
NARRATING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES → maybe this just needs to be a different label set, at the document not sentence level (or these are documents with multiple sentences in a row of SHARING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES)
