In general, label only explicit requests. Do not try to interpret or infer the user's intent.
Take users at their word. If they ask specifically for experiences, then it's not information. If they ask for emotional support, then it's not experiences.
You can apply more than label to a single sentence, but don't get too caught up in labeling every possible interpretation of a sentence. Focus on the main goal of the sentence.


========================================
NO LABEL  
========================================

thank yous
personal disclosures ("I'm getting married next month." "I prefer to keep things natural." "I'm a nurse." "I'm 15 years old.")
"bleeding after sex" (not enough information)
"even after the IUD my boyfriend" (sentence fragment)
"This is so great!" no context, no connection to birth control or health (might be about the community or something else)
"Thank you guys" (meta, community, not directly about birth control)
"Kyleena &amp; Lowered Arousal/Libido" (not enough information)
"Adderall for weight loss?" (not enough information)


========================================
WEIGHING OPTIONS
========================================

weighing and deciding between options
comparing different options
justifications for a certain option
"The thing is, I've heard that skipping placebo pills like that can cause spotting and breakthrough bleeding and such, which I want to avoid at all costs."
"Should I take Plan B?"
"I love the implant and feel like this is my only option."
"Which option is better?"
"I feel like there's no option for me."
"I began taking the combination pill (maexeni) mostly because I wanted to get rid of my period"
NOT: "I like my IUD" "I hate the implant"


========================================
HUMOR
========================================

must still be related to birth control and health
humor, jokes
"birth control is the second best thing a woman can put in her mouth to prevent pregnancy"

POSTIIVE SELF-DISCLOSURE
========================================

expressing personal relief/happiness/satisfaction
"I'm excited and petrified to get this Nexplanon taken out of my arm."

"Is it possible that it's gotten infected?"
"When will it stop hurting?"

"What should I do?"
"When should I start taking my placebo pills"
"I'm getting my Mirena inserted tomorrow, do you have any advice for me?"

factual information true in general, not providing direct advice
can be incorrect, as long as it's presented as factual
explanations of how birth control works
information about prices and access

========================================
NARRATING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
========================================

public journaling (self-tracking and storytelling)
"The doctor told me it was one of the lowest doses and should have had the least amount of side effects."
"My doctor said this is common for the first 2-6 months..."
"I'm going to start taking the pill next week."
"I'm planning on taking a pregnancy test if my period doesn't show up."
