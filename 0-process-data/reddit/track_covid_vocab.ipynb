It is light pinkish brown in color and looks to be mixed with a clear, mucusy discharge. A few days ago it was more red and reddish pink. This morning it was reddish pink. There have also been tiny clots and stringy membrane like bits in it as well almost every day. \n",

      "I recently watched a series on Netflix called Sex Explained. In this series there is an episode called Birth Control which mentions a non-steroidal/ hormonal birth control named Saheli. This birth control has ___VIRTUAL___ly no side effects and has been on the market in India for almost 30 years. Its active ingredient is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (Ormeloxifene). It’s a compound that acts on estrogen receptors in the uterus and prevents implantation from occurring. And it is only taken once a week. My mind was blown when I heard about this pill because all birth control I have ever tried here in the US has been a nightmare. I have tried various pills, the patch, IUD, Depo shot and I have experienced every side effect imaginable. After extensive research I decided to look into trying Saheli and ordered a year’s supply from AllDayChemist. The transaction went fine and I received my order about a month later. I am currently on my second week of taking this birth control and so far so good. I have experienced a few mild hot flashes but it is normal to experience this while your body adjust to the pill. They come and subside very quickly and it hasn't been bothersome enough for me to want to discontinue use. I'll take hot flashes over weight gain and vomiting any day. I want to know if anyone else has ever heard of this birth control? Have any of you tried it? If so what was your experience? I plan to come on here periodically and post updates.\n",

      "I feel a little misled because when I went to a walk in clinic the way the NP educated me about Depo was that there were ___VIRTUAL___ly no side effects. I had no idea that 2 out of 3 women experienced weight gain and that it could lead to osteoporosis. She only really told me about the benefits like only worrying about getting injections four times a year and it being one of the best progesterone-only options. She also led me way off the mini pill by saying if I didn’t take it at the same time every day it would be like I was taking no birth control at all. Little did I know there are more progesterone pill options that do offer 12 hour windows, that clinic just didn’t offer them. 🤦‍♀️\n",

      "Anyway, I can’t have estrogen (my mom and grandma had issues with too much estrogen which contributes to stage 1 breast cancer) and I’m looking for other options.

But I am currently on Nexplanon, and let me tell you, I was SO scared to go on it. The stories about the weight gain, the mood swings, the acne, bleeding for months on end, it was terrifying. But I also know that it’s ultimately up to your body when it comes to how it’s going react. I’ve been on it for about 5 months and I love it. No acne issues, no weight gain, I spot every now and again and get occasional cramps, but nothing bad at all. Hearing people’s stories can be beneficial to know what CAN happen, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to happen to YOU. My advice is to try it out, if it’s not good, stop and change.

      "\n",
      "3.5 years ago I got in a serious relationship and was going travelling so I wanted a bc I didn’t have to worry about. Found a few videos recommending IUD’s. Did a crap ton of research and decided hormonal IUD’s were best for me. \n",
      "Was leaving in 3 months for trip and didn’t have a gyno because I was young. Didn’t want my family doctor inserting it because he scared me. Rushed to find a gyno who would take me on as a patient. Eventually found the ob/gyn that delivered me and he took me on as a patient (lol). \n",
      "We had a consultation and at this point I was HELLA nervous my god. I had read so many horror stories so I was prepared for the worst. Eventually the insertion appointment came. I took two ibuprofens beforehand and went it. Almost had 5 panic attacks in the waiting room. He measured my uterus &amp; then stuck it in &amp; dang all that worrying for a minor pinch? I barely felt anything. It was a miracle. \n",
      "I drove myself home. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had pretty bad cramps the rest of the night, but just about on the same level as period cramps. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I go to check on the string a week later and it’s GONE. I just about had a panic attack. So I book an appointment with my gyno and he refers me to get an ultrasound. Mind you, I’m 18 years old at this point and hadn’t even had sex yet. So all of these people looking at my vagina was scary af. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways I learned that I have a partially septated uterus but that didn’t mean anything. It just freaked me out. I also learned that the IUD was still there! Thank god. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, so I had spotting for the next week or so and had one day where I got so dizzy that I almost passed out (while I was working). Then my periods began to get lighter and lighter. They became almost non-existent for a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tbh felt fine for most of it. The only part that freaked me out was that I couldn’t check on the string to make sure it was there. So my partner and I just used the pull out method as a “just in case”. I had a few pregnancy scares but it was never anything, just my anxiety. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah so the rest of the 2.5 years with the jaydess were rock solid. It was just the initial six months that were a bit rocky. Body getting used to the hormones and such. I would definitely recommend it!\n",
      "\n",
      "But as my time with the jaydess was ending, I started having to come to grips with the fact I would have a harder time getting it out because of the lack of string. This is when the second round of anxiety hit. \n",
      "I had just moved 2 years ago and didn’t have a gyno yet, so I go in October to get a referral to the best gyno in my area. It was mid January before I called my doctor again to confirm the referral. Turns out they forgot about me lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I end up getting an appointment about 2 weeks after the 3 year mark. I was shitting myself nervous. My poor boyfriend put up with all of my anxiety. I was so hecking nervous that I’d have to be hospitalized to get the thing out. \n",
      "\n",
      "But at the same time, I wanted another IUD because the last one had been so good. This time around there was a new IUD introduced called the Kyleena and it released fewer hormones than the mirena but lasted 5 years instead of 3. Swoon! \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, two days ago I got the IUD removed and I’m living to tell the tale. The removal was ___VIRTUAL___ly pain free. I was SHOCKED. \n",
      "I took two ibuprofens beforehand and then just went in. I also told my gyno about my health anxiety and she talked me down. She was such a sweet lady. She started by doing swabs of my cervix, then used this mascara type wand to try and find the string, and then resorted to an internal probe kind of thing that went into my uterus. I didn’t feel pain but I could definitively feel the metal stick enter my uterus lol. Was a weird feeling. And then 5 seconds later “I GOT IT!” and holy moly I almost cried. 3 years of worrying and it took like 30 seconds to get out. Then in about 30 more seconds the new one was inserted and I kid you not, I didn’t even feel it. The gyno was like “you didn’t even flinch”! And That’s the story. I had minor spotting and cramps that night but now I feel 100% normal. I think it might be because I’m used to the hormones already so it didn’t affect me the second time around as much but time shall tell!

      "Hi everyone! I wanted to create this post because over the past year, I really struggled with the Nexplanon implant and couldn't find much information or advice on dealing with it or what transitioning to an IUD would be like. \n",
      "\n",
      "**My Experience with the Nexplanon**\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to get the Nexplanon because unwanted pregnancy is a crippling fear of mine. The Nexplanon insertion was quick and painless. I was left with a small bruise that healed in days, and eventually transitioned into having sex without condoms without having to worry about pregnancy. HOWEVER, I almost always had to wear a pantyliner or pad, because there was about a 90% chance I would suddenly start spotting at any given point. The side effects I experienced on the Nexplanon were mood swings, acne and CONSTANT bleeding. I was already prone to hormonal acne pre-insertion, but I was willing to take the risk if it meant having a birth control method with very minimal insertion stress and super high efficacy. However, I ended up going on Accutane because my acne got so bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the bleeding - At first, this was very light spotting, but at the end, it was just a constant heavy period. I have seen posts by other concerned women on this nonstop bleeding, and I would like to relay that as long as you speak with your gynecologist and rule out all other sources of bleeding (infection, STDs, etc.), abnormal bleeding on the implant is one of the most common side effects, and besides being really annoying, is not actually harmful aside from POSSIBLY making you temporarily anemic (which you can treat with Iron supplements). This was the advice given to me directly from my gynecologist. You most likely will not need to rush to the ER over some irregular bleeding, so just be sure to speak with your gynecologist and have a pelvic exam/STD swab if recommended to you! If you continue to have irregular bleeding for 3 months after insertion, your gynecologist will likely prescribe you with a lose-dose birth control pill, such as lo-estro, to attempt to regulate the bleeding. This worked for me in the short term, but as soon as I finished a pill pack, the bleeding came back. As my doctor put it, it is usually only a bandaid for the underlying problem. Your first few months of having the implant are usually very indicative of how the rest of time having your implant with go. For some women, taking BC pills for a few months can actually fix their problems entirely. I did not want to continue taking birth control pills, because the combination pills prescribed to me contained both progestin and estrogen, meaning I was getting double the dose of progestin which really messed with my hormones, and I got the implant so I *wouldn't* have to take a pill everyday. \n",
      "\n",
      "It may sound silly that I endured these side effects for so long, but the fear of pregnancy and the fear of getting an IUD were so strong that I was willing to do anything to make the Nexplanon work for my body. Plus, every ‘solution’ had a trial period of about 3 months. I ended up taking birth control pills for around 7 months of the 12 that I actually had the Nexplanon. At the end of the day, my doctor recommended I have the implant removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Information about the Implant and the IUD Options I Was Given**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nexplanon implant is a progesterone-only birth control method. It is the only implant FDA-approved in the United States. The Nexplanon and Implanon are ___VIRTUAL___ly the same, but the Nexplanon is actually the Implanon's replacement by the same manufacturer. In comparison, the Nexplanon's introduction came with an improved insertion device, which meant less room for insertion error, which means higher efficacy and easier insertion procedures. Furthermore, the Nexplanon is detectable by X-ray, while the Implanon was not (The Implanon \"XT\" is radiopaque, however!).  Because it is inserted into your arm, the progestin travels through your blood stream, causing a greater distribution of progestin in your body. In comparison, hormonal IUDs work directly in your uterus. It is hard to measure how much progestin actually reaches your uterus from the Nexplanon because it is a circulatory drug. Because the nexplanon does not contain estrogen, women like me who have constant bleeding as a side effect usually experience this because the uterine lining cannot stabilize/form from the lack of estrogen and will just keep shedding in result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nexplanon and birth control pills prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation, while the hormonal IUD works primarily by creating a cervical mucus plug which stops sperm from entering the uterus and secondarily by thinning the uterine lining. You are still ovulating while having a hormonal IUD, which is why periods either regulate, lighten and shorten or stop entirely for most women, because the uterine lining gets thinner and thinner over time, meaning less blood to shed and no where for an egg to attach! The likelihood of your period stopping entirely depends on the type of hormonal IUD you choose. The Mirena is the only recommended hormonal IUD for heavy periods and irregular bleeding because it contains such a high level of progesterone. Unfortunately, the Mirena is the largest, and therefore \\*potentially\\* most painful hormonal IUD to get inserted. The other types of hormonal IUDS recommended to me were Kyleena, Liletta and Skyla. The Skyla is rarely used anymore, because the Kyleena is seen as more convenient and came out as a replacement to the Skyla; the Kyleena contains a higher level of hormones and lasts 5 years rather than 3, and is the same size.   Some sources suggest that the Mirena could last up to 7 years, while the Liletta is only recommended for three to four. Mirena contains 52 mg of levonorgestrel, Liletta contains 52 mg of levonorgestrel, and Kyleena contains 19.5 mg of levonorgestrel and Skyla contains 13.5 mg. The Paraguard IUD is a nonhormonal option which lasts 10 years and operates by creating an inhospitable environment for sperm via its copper coil.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Switching from the Nexplanon to IUD**\n",
      "\n",
      "I ultimately chose to switch from the Nexplanon to the Kyleena IUD because I did not want to deal with the constant spotting anymore, and the Kyleena is one of the smallest IUDs with up to 5 years of protection from pregnancy. Before officially switching birth control methods, my gynecologist required that I attend a 1 hour information session on the different types of IUDs and how the procedure is done so that I would know what to expect. There, a doctor showed me and a few other young ladies a powerpoint with some of the information I have included above, passed around prototypes of the different IUDs so we could see what the real thing looks like in person, and she showed us the insertion tools and gave a demonstration on a Uterus and Ovary plastic model.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had my Kyleena insertion and Nexplanon removal in the same appointment. My doctor placed the IUD first to ensure that everything went smoothly before removing my primary form of BC.  Your arm is numbed for the Nexplanon removal so I did not feel anything, and I currently have a very small scar, hardly visible, on my arm from where it was extracted. The Kyleena insertion was quick and simple, and I was lucky to not experience much pain - just minor discomfort, a rolling, NOT sharp cramp. I was terrified going in, but actually asked the gynecologist, \"Wait, it's already over?\" when she was finished inserting my IUD. I was diligent in taking the recommended ibruprofen before and after the procedure, and used a heating pad to dull the cramps once at home. I know that all women are different, so again, I must stress that YMMV. The cramps lasted for a few hours, and I felt 100% the net day. \n",
      "\n",
      "**My experience with the Kyleena**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not had an actual period since getting my Kyleena inserted. I had minor spotting a week after insertion, and so far, that's all I have had. I have not had any other side effects. Since clearing on Accutane, my acne did not resurge with the change in birth control methods. I would 100% recommend trying the Kyleena to anyone considering it! \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my main gynecologist and the one who performed the procedure if it was necessary for me to consistently check my IUD strings, and they both told me no. My primary GYN said that because the strings soften significantly, and oftentimes 'tuck' up, women will come into the office freaking out that their IUD is gone when usually they just can't feel it. My partner felt a small poke of the strings when we first had sex after insertion (a week later I think?) and since then, the strings have softened, and he only occasionally feels them with no pain to either of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TLDR;** I had the Nexplanon for over a year and tried almost everything to counteract the side-effects. Did a lot of my own research and asked a lot of questions along the way. Had to go on Accutane to combat the hormonal acne. Finally switched to the Kyleena after conquering my fears of the insertion, and I don't regret a thing from this entire experience.\n",

      "This has been noted by my GP, Endocrinologist, and Nutritionist, all of whom know it is hormonal and have thought that something similar to PCOS could be occurring. I went on the combo pill due to awful cramps as a teen. Given that Lo Lo gave me the least severe side effects, I’m inclined to think I may just be very sensitive to estrogen, as well as perhaps the type of progestin in the pills before generation 4 (ones derived from testosterone). \n",
      "\n",
      "I am at a bit of a crossroads now. The last ER doctor put me on fluoxetine as a precaution and I have been on it almost a year now. However, my gut is telling me that this is due to a hormonal imbalance that may have been cultivated by the combo pill. One method forward is to treat my probable PCOS with a different birth control form. Perhaps a pill with progestin only or maybe a progestin only IUD, given that I do think estrogen negatively effects me. \n",

      "\n",
      "1) Started BC pills (Alesse) when I was 13 because my periods were incredibly heavy. Was on these pills for 8 years\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Got Mirena IUD. Insertion was fine. First 3 years were great - barely had periods and was ___VIRTUAL___ly symptom free besides possibly slightly increased depression, but I also went back to school during this time. For the last 3 years got insane bloating - I'm fairly thin and would look 4-5 months pregnant for months at a time. Periods came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Switched to Nexplanon implant. First year was fine, but then periods started to get insanely heavy and looooooooooong. And my cycle was weird, I would have like 4 mini-cycles with a long heavy period, a week off, a long heavy period, a week off, etc ... and then the normal 3 weeks between periods. Also increase of depression and anxiety started, but I also started a PhD program during this time so it's hard to tell if the Nexplanon caused/didn't help mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Switched back to Alesse in the hopes that periods would get regular/lighter. Took one pack of pills. Immediately after my first actual period on Alesse I had a 3-day panic attack and ended up in the ER. My OB/GYN doesn't think the Alesse caused it, but I am CONVINCED it did. The timing was too coincidental, and it was like I was having all of the physical symptoms of my parasympathetic nervous system being in overdrive but none of the mental symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this experience I decided I was done with hormonal birth control for a while and was a little wary of using only condoms, so Paraguard it was! During the actual insertion, my OB had a little bit of trouble finding my cervix/getting it into a good position for insertion. It was slightly uncomfortable to have her poking around trying to find it, but definitely not painful. The worst pain was from measuring the uterus - I definitely had a major cramp when the sound hit the top of my uterus. But I was able to breathe through it and it was over in \\~10 seconds. The actual IUD insertion was another cramp that lasted a little bit longer (\\~20 seconds) but was less painful/severe than the previous one. I felt totally fine afterward - did not take any painkillers before and after. I have a fairly high pain tolerance, but I also think it was a very manageable pain level. Several hours later I'm having a tiny bit of cramping, but no more severe than moderate period cramps.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a little bit worried about heavier periods on Paraguard since I struggle with low iron levels, but my OB/GYN seems pretty cool with letting me get my iron tested whenever I want and monitoring it closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just wanted to provide a positive Paraguard story since there are so many IUD insertion horror stories. This is NOT AT ALL to discredit or invalidate awful and painful experiences that other people have had - I can ABSOLUTELY see how people get freaked out, how it can be incredibly painful, how it can be hard mentally -  but more to say don't necessarily go into your IUD insertion experience with the mindset that it's going to be awful!\n",

      "Hey everyone! I’ve been on the patch for 4 years and just decided to make the switch to an IUD. Since I haven’t seen a lot of stuff on this subreddit about the patch I thought I’d share my experience!\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the patch I had really heavy and painful periods. I would bleed through pads and tampons regularly and bleed onto my clothing. I would pass really painful clots and sometimes I would even get dizzy or pass out from my period. So when I was 18 I got the patch because I wanted a birth control method that was easy and I didn’t have to remember to take every day. \n",
      "\n",
      "On my first period I could instantly tell a difference from my usual period (pre-patch). It was much lighter and less painful (I barely had any cramping on the patch). My mood became better and was more stable. My only negative side effect at first was as my body was adjusting to the hormones in the first 4 months I had bad cystic acne from the patch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over my four years I really enjoyed my time on the patch. My periods were really enjoyable and got progressively lighter as time went on until I barely bled at all. The only troubles I had was the patch itself was that long showers or hot baths would sometimes make it come off at the edges. I would also put a layer of protective waterproof dressing (tegaderm) before swimming and that made the patch stay on. I did notice though that on beach vacations I would get some breakthrough bleeding indicating to me that it’s possible that some of the hormones from the patch may have gotten washed away by the water. (Additionally I learned that if you’re on the patch you’re not supposed to go in saunas or tanning beds as the heat can make the hormones dump into your body all at once.) I even managed to lose 20 pounds on the patch!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to get off the patch mainly because it just wasn’t right for my lifestyle and a few side effects that I noticed happened gradually over time. I noticed that really slowly over the four years my sex drive started to decrease until it was ___VIRTUAL___ly nonexistent and made dating hard for me. I also noticed that when I did have sex I would experience vaginal dryness and it wasn’t as easy to have sex as it was before the patch. Also I’m really a water person and I love taking baths so having to constantly worry about those activities made me want to switch to a different method of birth control. Additionally, the patch has the highest hormone levels and I get migraines so I shouldn’t be on estrogen. Ultimately I decided on switching to an IUD (Kyleena) for the comfort of you get it in and forget about it for 5 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I really liked the patch. It made my periods lighter and easier for the four years I was on it without any major side effects. But decreased sex drive, high hormone levels, and the ease of an IUD as a birth control method made me switch. \n",

      "So! It's been a while since I updated anything about the IUD because it's been a while since I've had issues with it! I don't remember all of the details now, so feel free to ask any questions. I had it removed December 14th, thankfully then because originally the date was January 16th but the sexual health clinic called me and told me they had an opening in a few days. It felt sudden, but of course it was better to have it out sooner. When I got there, I told the nurse there what was happening. My hair falling out (not in clumps but shedding all over), and my gums receding, but I don't believe the IUD was the cause of my gum recession. My memory is foggy now, but I think I didn't have gum recession until a while after I had my IUD in, and because I was attempting \"mewing\" and I was clenching my jaw a lot, and my gumline disappeared. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I went in and talked to the nurse, who tried convincing me to either try a different method along with the IUD (like hair growth pills or the like), different supplements, giving it more time ect. She wasn't pushy about it, just asked a lot if I wanted to do that, or if I was just done and wanted it out. For sure, I wanted it out, but only because I *knew* my hair wouldn't stop falling out (or at least I couldn't keep waiting to see if it would, I'd go bald by then), and because i would have rather just had a different method of birth control rather than having to accommodate this one random method. So I went into the little room and undressed, and the nurse took the IUD out. All she did was pull on the strings, and it hurt (the same way it hurt getting put in, but two whole seconds, a very sharp cramp), but then it was over. I got my period right after, or what I remember would have been maybe a day after or something. My hair loss has stopped, thankfully. I don't know how much has grown back so far, I think it's all coming in gradually. I haven't seen any little small hairs all sprouting up. But it certainly feels better than it did before, and while I may be imagining it, it doesn't feel as thin as it did before. I don't feel any psychological or mental differences, just that I'm glad my hair isn't falling out anymore. I had taken a break from birth control, up until now. I realized all IUD's use Levonorgestrel, except for the copper IUD, which I have an instinctive feeling would be really bad for my body. Plus, I don't really want heavier periods (they're heavy enough as is), and I feel the copper in my body wouldn't react well. I also never really liked the strings in my body.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if anyone tells you that the hair loss in your body CANNOT be caused from the IUD, they are most definitely wrong. I'm no doctor, and maybe technically it SHOULDN'T happen, but clearly there are many different factors going on, and *something* was definitely causing hair loss. I'm now using Lolo (lo Loestrin Fe), which I've used in the past without any noticeable side effects. I wanted something more permanent, and I might try some other long term method, but most likely only until I ___RUN OUT___ of this prescription (which I did get free, once, but now costs like $20/month :/).\n",

After a month of taking it (I skipped the sugar pills in order to skip my period) my acne was gone! I was confident to show my back and wear swimsuits! Then December came around and I was bleeding.

I started getting scared that the bleeding wouldn't stop, so I stopped taking bc. The bleeding stopped after a week of stopping bc and I was relieved, but it didn't last long.

When I started taking it for the first time ever, I took it for roughly 9 months and then stopped because I went away for a job placement (I'm a university student) and I was going to be far away from my then-boyfriend at the time. Plus, our relationship was deteriorating and we were on the verge of breaking up during those last few months of the relationship. So due to this as well, I didn't plan on having sex anytime soon, mostly due to heartbreak. This ended up being a lie because 4 months after I stopped taking them, I started taking them again and have been ever since. I don't know if it matters but I have been taking the BC pills for exactly a year now (continuously &amp; not counting those initial 9 months). So now that I provided the background and context, what's your take on taking BC pills on and off? Cause when I do decide to be intimate again (ya know, after the pandemic is over), I might want to take it again.

Around 5 years ago at a family planning clinic appointment the contraceptive nurse told me that if I liked I could run the packs together and not take placebo pills so I didn't have a period. She gave me an NHS fact sheet on how it's completely safe and explained that it wasn't even a real period, it was a withdrawal bleed that was purposely created when the pill was first designed.

      "Hi everyone! I wanted to relay my recent experience/scare with an expired nexplanon with the hope that others in my shoes can feel a bit reassured.  **Short story: the nexplanon WORKS several months past 3-year mark.** \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, when I went in to get my nexplanon replaced after 3 years, my doctor strongly discourgaged it and said it is good for 4 years. As a result, I didn't get it removed. A month later (3 months after the expiration date) - I had a missed period (even though it had been pretty consistent for the past year), and exhibited pregancy symptoms (bloating, nausea, headache). Turns out I was not pregant and my period came 2 weeks later. It was pretty scary so I turned to science to help calm me down. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, there have been at least 10 independent studies on the extended use of nexplanon. The studies were conducted in multiple countries (ex: US, China, Thailand), and some were done with randomized control trials - basically the gold standard in exprimentation. Not a single study found an increase in risk of pregancy in year 4. However, these studies had limited sample size.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a report available of the data submitted to the FDA to get the implanon approved.  [https://www.___ACCESS___data.fda.gov/drugsatfda\\_docs/nda/2006/021529s000\\_ClinPharmR.pdf](https://www.___ACCESS___data.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2006/021529s000_ClinPharmR.pdf) . Basically, your body needs a certain threshold level of a hormone to prevent pregancy, and this level is higher if you are over weighed. The research found that at 3 years, 100% of people of all BMI passed the threshold. at 3.5 years, 93% of people of all BMI were above the threshold (with 100% people with BMI &lt;25 passing). That was pretty convincing. I think a big reason why the FDA set the expiration at 3 years is because the data on obese people is a bit weak. \n",

      "\n",
      "So, for those who might be scared about increased risk of pregnancy with a newly expired nexplanon - science is on your side.However, do note that the prevailing medical recommendation is to replace after 3 years, as the data for extended use is not comprehensive (despite planned parenthood's advocacy for 5 years).\n",

I continued using them until december when I saw a gynecologist and she (predictably) told me stop. \n",

I’ve been on combo pill before and didn’t like the way it affected me and also, the possibility of user error terrifies me. i’m deathly afraid of becoming pregnant before i am ready because a) I want to lessen the possibility of ever needing an abortion to the best of my ability and b) i am in a family situation where i would not be supported should i ever need an abortion  and because of that my ___ACCESS___ might be limited. \n",

There was a button you could press to avoid actually verbally asking someone to open it, but after pressing it and standing around feeling stupid for five minutes, I realized no one was coming and tracked down an employee the old fashioned way. And then waited another five minutes while she tracked down someone high-ranking enough to have the key. \n",

Come on though, this store had like eight self-checkout lanes! If someone's too ashamed to buy condoms or Plan B at the self-checkout, making them get someone to open the case and stand there staring while they pick it out is going to make them *not buy it*.\n",

      "\n",
      "I started taking tri-sprintec at 18 to help with my horrible periods, and it was perfect for me. However, I found out after a few years on it that I shouldn't have been prescribed it due to my migraines with aura. So, I switched to norethindrone. It made me incredibly sick and I was so miserable that I preferred my horrible periods over being on that pill. I have major anxiety surrounding medical procedures, so an IUD/impant/shot are out of the question for me, and because I need the hormones to regulate my period and prevent me from becoming incapacitated once a month, I'm skeptical that any of those hormones would work for me anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost gave up hope, until at my last OB appointment she told me about Slynd. Super fascinating, its the only new progesterone only pill to be introduced in the market in over 50 years. And, its unique because it uses the type of progesterone that is typically used in combo pills (which I'm not allowed to take) rather than the type usually used in mini pills (which make me horribly sick). It works PERFECTLY and I was so thrilled to find a solution.\n",

Its been a total nightmare. \n",

I just ordered 3 packs for $60 total WITHOUT INSURANCE and it will refill/be delivered to my home every three months now. Even with whatever magic my OB tried to work at the pharmacy, I still had to pay nearly $100 for 3 packs last time.

I had little to no side effects (I think my boobs were sore for the first two months but that's literally it). That being said, the extreme stress of remembering to take it on time was making me extremely paranoid. I'm a severe hypochondriac. I would convince myself that I missed a pill or took it too late, or was like one of the few unlucky folks that still conceive while on the pill. I was convinced I pregnant every single time. My only reasoning for long term birth control is the whole state of the US right now, and I would hate to lose ___ACCESS___ to birth control while on the pill.

I'm one of the lucky gals that have a pretty easy period, so I'm not exactly worried about making my period easier. I've heard copper ones can make them heavier but wouldn't mind so much. But I've heard they are very, VERY effective against pregnancy. I've also been debating on whether or not I want kids in the future, and I've heard (please correct me if I'm wrong) that IUDs can occasionally cause infertility if something goes wrong. So, even then, I wouldn't be mad if they caused me to become infertile. My problem is I have a very tilted uterus. Sometimes it's not as bad as others, but it's enough to make it hard for me to put in tampons and make them slightly uncomfortable. I feel like having a tilted uterus would make the insertion of it very hard, and painful. Not to mention the risk of it moving.\n",

      "**My experience:** I went into Planned Parenthood today and after waiting two hours was welcomed back into a private room. (Side note: I am currently without health insurance and employment and feel extremely grateful for the services PP provides, especially during these Covid times.) The medical assistant took my blood pressure, asked me for some basic information, gave me Nexplanon informational paperwork, and had me sign a consent. She told me that I would need to keep the pressure wrap on for 24 hours, the band aid on for three days, and that I could shower before the 24 hours were up if I covered the wrap in plastic first. I then waited some more and eventually the FNP came in. She was very kind and apologetic about my long wait. She asked if I had any questions and when I said \"no,\" was quick to get into the process of preparing my arm for Nexplanon insertion. They chose my non-dominate arm and she had me put my hand behind my head, so that she would have better ___ACCESS___ to the fleshy part of my inner-upper arm. First, she cleaned and numbed the area. Next, the insertion occurred. I won't lie, there was pain involved. While she was completing the procedure, she accidentally hit the light switch and the room went dark. She turned them back on almost immediately and I was pretty distracted by the pain, but it was still a bit freaky nonetheless. Within just a couple of minutes, the procedure was complete and she asked me to touch and feel the Nexplanon with my right hand. I did, and felt weird about it. She bandaged me up and asked how I was feeling. I told her I was feeling okay and that I was a little bit nervous about what the medical assistant told me that there was a chance it may pop out. She said that she used to be a rep for the company and in her years of experience, she had never seen anything like that happen before. I felt reassured. I sat up and she offered me water which I eagerly accepted. She apologized about the lights out situation and explained to me that the woozy feeling I might be experiencing was due to a decrease in adrenaline upon receiving the insertion. She said it is common for folks to feel this way afterwards, especially after a build-up of anticipation. She said that it's normal if I feel the need to lay down for a while afterwards. I felt out of it and unwell almost immediately upon completion of the procedure. I went and got Taco Bell, thinking that it might help me to feel better. It helped me to feel comforted, but didn't take away the out of it, woozy feeling. I'm back home now and in bed - where I feel I belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips:** Have a friend or family member drive you. If that's not an option, prepare to baby yourself upon completion of the procedure. Bring water and snacks with you for once the procedure is complete, and maybe, if your experience goes anything like mine - for while you wait.\n",

I found some older posts, but their experiences essentially stop at \"and then I got Mirena yesterday, so far so good.\"   I've been on Nexplanon for a total of 4 years now and I'm exhausted of the perpetual bleeding and PMS (mood swings, cramps, etc.); my gyn today asked if I was interested in Mirena and I said I'd let her know.

      "One downside of my gynefix was that healthcare professionals were less knowledgeable about it. When there was concern that it may have shifted, they weren't able to tell me immediately with an ultrasound and I had to be referred to a specialist!

      "I did experience some worsening of deep pain during sex with the gynefix and also some issues with post coital bleed. Overall however, I had one for 7 years and switched mainly because I wanted to trial a hormonal method to help control my periods and help with PMS symptoms. My one thing to say is I do think overall, getting an IUD fitted in a specialist clinic seems to lead to a better experience as they do a greater number of fittings per clinician, and hence are more experienced with the procedure. \n",

I had tried femodette COC, the POP (cerazette) and Microgynon and found they all had a negative affect upon my mood andgave me breast tenderness.

      "This sub was so helpful to me four years ago when I was researching the IUD I wanted to share my experience. I had the Mirena IUD for four years, and overall it served me well as a birth control. My only side effect was spotting after sex, which was due to the strings irritating capillaries on the opening of my cervix. Ultimately this was not harmful and not a big deal so I kept it, although it did bother me. I am also weird and didn’t love not having a period, although I had very very light spotting every cycle. The insertion process for me was painful, and was made worse by the fact that I felt like the doctor was rude to me during the experience. I want to be honest with women that for me it was painful, but ultimately doable and worth it. My advice would be to try and find a care provider who is kind and who you like. \n",

My partner and I would like to have a child within the next two years, and I wanted to have a chance to get re-acquainted with the way my cycles work before then, since I have been on one form of birth control or another since I was a teenager. We will be using condoms and the symptothermal method of fertility awareness until we are ready to start trying (I know this isn’t for everyone and am just sharing my journey). I was extremely nervous about the removal process, because the insertion process was not great for me. I was having bad dreams about it for the whole week before it happened. I opted to see a midwife rather than an OBGYN, who sat with me for thirty minutes answering questions about reproductive health and issues I’d had before we did anything clinical, which was such a wonderful change from my experiences with OBGYNs. I would recommend this to anyone who has ___ACCESS___ to a midwife and has felt unsatisfied with care from an OBGYN (they don’t just deliver babies! They can provide well-person care as well!) After our convo she removed my IUD. It felt like a long, slow cramp, and then it was over! 1/10000 of the pain of getting it in!

I spoke to them this morning to ask if I could get prescriptions for an anti-anxiety med and misoprostol before my appointment. They called back to say they would not prescribe me either--\"misoprostol only helps for insertion\" and since the OB/GYN hadn't seen me before, they would't prescribe the anti-anxiety medication either.

Because of that, and because of my recent struggle with the pill (covid has messed up my daily schedule and while I do take it every day I’m having trouble doing it at the same time every day), I would like to transition to a more long-term method like the implant or an IUD.

      "This happened in California: In July of 2014, when I was 18, I went to a very reputable free women's health clinic and got the copper IUD inserted. The insertion was fine, everything was normal and looked good. the pain was as expected, but wasn't long lasting and I didn't have much bleeding. I made an appointment for a check up for one month after the insertion date. I was advised to check the strings once in a while to make sure it was still in place. I did this once a week after insertion and everything felt normal. The third week in, I notice the strings are moderately lower than they had been previously. I thought, oh well my appointment is in about a week, shouldn't be an issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later I start feeling VERY sick. Full body aches, and uncontrollable fever of 103+. I experienced this for about 24 hours before I thought I should go in and see urgent care. I honestly thought it was probably mono again (since I had it before and it felt just like this) and I was being a big baby. I was driven to urgent care and they took me in before everyone else in the waiting room (I must've looked very sick) and immediately took my blood pressure. They left for a few minutes and came back in asking my permission to call an ambulance to drive me to the ER down the street. I refused because I already felt guilty going in there when I felt \"not thaaaat sick\" and it was just around the corner, I could just drive. So, they insisted on wheelchairing me out to the car and said I must drive straight there, no stopping under any circumstance. I was weirded out but obliged. Once in the ER about 5 minutes later, they took me right back into triage and wheeled me out to a bed. At this point I was still feeling ridiculous because I swore I just had the flu and was overreacting. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is when I realized something was seriously wrong. I had about three+ doctors hovering over me, putting IVs in both arms, taking blood, all those things. They called my parents and told them, \"you need come here to see your daughter NOW.\" I started developing a red itchy rash on my hards and feet that drove me nuts. My heart rate was 180+ and my blood pressure was extremely low (in the 80/40 and lower range.) In the ER bed, they did an emergency central line into my neck and said they were taking me to the ICU, where I stayed for four delirious days. During this time they aggressively pumped me with fluids to keep my blood pressure up. I gained 15 pounds of fluid in a few hours if you can believe it. Because of this, the excess fluid pooled into my chest cavity, successfully crushing my lungs into pancakes. I felt like I was suffocating. I had a massive needle and vacuum put in my back to suck out all the fluid and reinflate my lungs, and was put on oxygen. I was on Dilaudid every few hours. I had more antibiotics pumped into me than I could count. I was given a 20% chance of survival.\n",

      "LONG story short, I had somehow gotten Toxic Shock Syndrome from the dislodged IUD. This had then turned into Sepsis, and then Septic Shock. I had so many tests and scans and ultrasounds but it all came back to the IUD. There were secondary complications that were painful. I was subject to hours of being on hard plastic boards and pumped with radioactive substances for scans. The rash on my hands and feet made my skin slough off. It was awful! I spent another 3 days in the cardiac department after the 4 days in ICU before I got to go home and recover. All of this because the IUD somehow slipped down. \n",

      "HA. Jokes on you, I wanted an IUD to work for me so badly that three years later my doctor got a group of all the best doctors in my area to debrief about what happened and if it was safe for me to get another one. Their conclusion? This was a freak accident that had never been recorded happening with an IUD before and it was surely impossible for it to happen again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Que me getting a smaller, hormonal IUD. To keep things simple, yes, it happened again. I got Toxic Shock Syndrome,  again, and went septic, again. The second time I caught it early enough that I wasn't in too bad of shape and was out of the hospital in four days, 2 days in ICU and 2 days in the women's department. There were complications this time too, like a botched spinal tap that didn't seal resulting in gnarly spinal headaches that required a blood patch. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the moral of this story is that sometimes certain birth controls just won't agree with you. Be careful, and be aware of what your body is telling you. I happen to be a freak case where IUDs make my body self destruct. I've never heard of this happening to anyone else and I really wonder if anyone else has experienced this to the degree I have. If IUDs work for you then I am SO happy for you, I wish I could be like you. \n",

I'm not currently sexually active so I was planning to wait, but with recent events here in the US things are looking bleak. The problem is I can't just go on the pill (which would be easier in my situation) because my period is already very good and regular and I don't want to mess it up. I am also rather susceptible to depression and I don't want to mess with my hormones. A copper IUD seems like the best option for me since it is non hormonal and seems to be effective if inserted properly. However my parents are very strict and if I go asking them for an IUD they will most certainly refuse. I don't quite understand why since I am trying to prevent having a child that I am unable and unwilling to care for. They don't seem to realize that they can't stop me from having sex in the future. So my question is how would I go about getting an IUD without them knowing? I live in Massachusetts and if anyone has any info about how this state handles things please let me know! I don't think I could use my insurance because I wouldn't want my parents seeing that. I'm not really sure how to sneak around them like that. All I could really do is take a trip to the nearest planned parenthood because I am going to get my license very soon. I don't have the money to cover the whole cost of it myself because I am unfortunately not allowed to work and it's very stressful. If anyone can offer some sort of info or help at all, please do. It's scary how in___ACCESS___ible birth control is to some people and even scarier that it could soon become in___ACCESS___ible to more.

      "Some background: I’m 25, never been pregnant, and from the UK. I’ve been in a long term monogamous relationship for nearly 6 years and for the first 5 years or so I had Nexplanon implants (I have a history of migraines with auras so was advised to not take the combined pill). I have always had an irregular cycle and the implant clearly also affected this as I was even less regular and experienced lots of spotting. I decided to remove the implant for various reasons, the main one being to see if my symptoms were related to the synthetic hormones or were just me. I have tracked my bleeding for over 6 years and am now starting to track other key signs such as discharge, mood, breast tenderness etc (for those interested: I use Clue but am also trialling Flo at the moment).\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to share my own personal anecdotal experience with the copper coil. I would always recommend people to do thorough research for themselves, of which anecdotal experiences can be a part of (but shouldn’t be the only sources used). I am personally of the belief that people more readily share their negative experiences (with the coil especially) and that we need to get as many people to share theirs, good and bad, to help people figure out for themselves what is best for them and their bodies. That being said, I am very disappointed to say I ultimately did not agree with the coil and had it removed after 9 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had my copper coil inserted December 2019, around the same time I had the implant removed. My experience of insertion was very painful and uncomfortable, and I immediately experienced heavy bleeding and cramping that left me bed ridden for 3 days. My irregular cycle means I’m never consistent with when, how long, how heavy or how painful my periods are but with the coil it was suddenly consistent.... consistently awful. The pain was debilitating and I bled heavier than I ever have. On the plus side I started to experience a SLIGHTLY more regular timing of cycle (though would still be classed as abnormal) and with the timing of the removal of my implant I am assuming this is more likely to be the reason for this. I was frequently uncomfortable and experienced some sharp pains which I had checked by the Dr and was told it was all fine and just unfortunate symptoms that should alleviate as it settled. I decided to wait it out and give it a proper shot despite the pain and discomfort. Things did improve but minimally, I would feel cramps, discomfort, and sometimes pain when “bearing down”, going to the bathroom, when I felt like I needed the bathroom, when I sneezed, when I stretched in certain ways, when I did any exercises that used lower abdominal muscles, and when having sex. I checked in with Drs when I needed to but it was never deemed to be a major issue and that ultimately it was fine (always feel the threads, coil didn’t slip, I had ultrasounds to check it was placed correctly). \n",
      "\n",
      "9 months in and I finally decided to throw in the towel, feeling like I’d given it a good go but it wasn’t worth it to me. I had really wanted it to be the right thing for me, but unfortunately it was not. Removal was quick and much MUCH better than insertion. A very short minor cramping and discomfort but it didn’t linger or cause any cramping or bleeding afterwards. Even better I felt almost immediately a physical relief of having it out, and on some level I also think mental. Having regular discomfort and pain meant I was frequently reminded of its presence and I always had it in the back of my mind something wasn’t quite right. Having sex again with my partner for the first time since it’s removal was frankly incredible. I cried with happiness afterwards. I have been struggling with a decreased libido over the past year or so, something I was hoping was due to the implant (from my experience and based on my instincts I think it was, though hormones are complicated). Then having issues with pain and discomfort during sex with the coil, it brought in a new level of avoiding sex which now I have solved and am beyond grateful! Moving forward we will be using condoms and I am learning to track my cycle better to understand my own body as best I can, something I think can be useful tool for those of us who menstruate. I am also extremely grateful I am in a position to get to try out different methods with relative ease, and that it’s not something everyone has ___ACCESS___ too (another reason I feel sharing my experience could maybe help others).  \n",

      "Let me start by saying, I live in the US and my health insurance has a high deductible of $1,500 a year that resets at the end of the year. So needless to say, I avoid any medical care unless it's free or I'm dying, specially at the end of the year because I know if I end up spending any money towards my deductible it will reset soon. With that being said, I do get a free Routine Preventive Physical Exam, and a free Routine Gynecological exam a year so I always take advantage of it. Additionally, anything related to Family Planning comes at no cost to me. So it's fair to say that I should be able to get the IUD for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all started when I needed a re-fill for my birth control pills prescription. I called the doctor's office and they said that in order to get a re-fill I needed to come in for a check-up because I had not gone this year. So I went ahead and scheduled an appointment with whomever could see me first. This was in December and I got an appointment for January.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was seen by a PA. At the appointment I mentioned that I was interested in trying an IUD instead of continuing with the pill. She said if I wanted, it can be done during this appointment. It didn't have much time to think about it but I figured since this appointment was free and another one might not be, I might as well do it then, so I agreed to have it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I signed some paperwork and she proceeded to get an IUD. I wasn't given any options to choose but I was able to see the package that said Kyleena.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Mirena, Kyleena is smaller and has smaller dose of hormones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I later read that they are supposed to test for STDs and pregnancy before attempting to insert an IUD and they did not do either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without not being too TMI here, there are a few steps for inserting and IUD:\n",
      "\n",
      "First the insert the speculum, similar to when they do a pap smear. This is uncomfortable, but didn't feel too bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, they clean your cervix with a solution to prevent any infection. Painless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she proceeds to stabilize my cervix with a tenaculum. Yeah that's as painful as it sounds. She warns me that I'm gonna feel a 'pinch'. It felt like the worst cramp I've ever had but it was brief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she use a tool called 'sound' to check for the length and direction of the cervical canal. It needs a reading of at least 6cm to avoid going too deep and perforating your uterus with the IUD insertion kit. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is when things got tough, she was getting a reading of just 3cm. She tried a few things, probably moving the tenaculum as I felt the 'pinch' a few more times and trying to dilate the cervix, and got to 4cm but couldn't get the the minimum requirement of 6cm. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is when she decided to get help from her attending physician. He then stepped in, tried it himself &lt;insert 'pinch' here yet again&gt; and said \"you weren't joking\" when he could not get a higher reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, probably from looking at my [\"Hide the pain Hardold\"](https://i.imgflip.com/1cf8by.jpg)  expression, they gave up.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the room and then the PA came back and told me we can try again at another appointment, this time with an assisted insertion to be able to see the uterus. My first question of course was \"Will the insurance cover it?\" to which she has no idea and suggested I asked the person making the appointment at the front desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to make the appointment, this time I requested my actual OBGYN since it seemed like it would be better to have an experienced doctor instead of a PA. When asking about my insurance the lady said: \"yeah you're insurance should cover it\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Spoiler alert, my insurance did cover it, but that doesn't mean I didn't have to pay… This is how I learned the real meaning of the word ___COVERAGE___ when it comes to insurance. Covered means they'll process it, it doesn't necessarily means they'll pay for it, specially if you have a deductible that hasn't been met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, it's now January, and my deductible is at 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day of the appointment my doctor calls me and ask that I go early for an ultrasound before she sees me to check for any abnormalities that might be preventing the IUD from being inserted. Made sense to me so I followed her advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did a pelvic and vaginal ultrasound. The ultrasounds didn't show anything abnormal. So when I actually go see her she couldn't understand how they couldn't insert the IUD before, so she's determined to give it a try herself before trying the assisted insertion. Lather, rinse and repeat, or more like, insert, pinch and repeat (ouch). No luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then we prepare for a hysteroscopy, which it's kind of like a endoscopy but of the uterus. Basically inserting a camera in there. This is used for surgery but in my case it was only exploratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "After putting anesthesia (another pinch, with a needle this time), they fill me up with water and insert a camera inside me. I was able to see on the screen what my doctor was seeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funny enough.. she couldn't find my cervix opening at all. She even said \"You get your period right? You must have a cervix opening then but I can't find it\". It looked like it diverted in two paths. She would follow one, and it would lead nowhere. She would go back, follow the other path, lead nowhere either. I saw it all, and was puzzled by it too. After trying a few times, she gave up. She told me she was going to consult with someone to read my ultrasound and verify what could be the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received a call the next day. From the ultrasound images and hysteroscopy they concluded my uterus is tilted forward 180 degrees (So a U-turn??) and due to this inserting an IUD will be difficult, if possible, and not advisable due to risk of perforation and expulsion. I agreed. Later on I read that this is referred to as \"anteflexed\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So two doctor visits, two doctors, one PA, multiple attempts each, one pelvic ultrasound, one vaginal ultrasound, one hysteroscopy, and a consult later, here ends my experience of trying to get an IUD, with no IUD.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a little sad and disappointed that IUDs were not an option for me anymore after all the good things I read about them: No daily pill, last for years, less hormones, localized in the uterus only, no periods, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the disappointment soon turned into shock. Later that month I received a bill for $1,115 dollars with the following breakdown: $640 for the \"surgery\", $315 for the ultrasounds, and another $160 for the ultrasound readings. Lucky me they didn't charge me for the visit too because they considered it my annual free routine check (which I just had had one the month before, so now I can no longer get my check up this year).\n",
      "\n",
      "I was determined to fight this since it seemed highly unfair that I needed to pay over one thousand dollars for leaving the doctor's office without the intended IUD. And also because Family Planning it's free and this was all Family Planning related.\n",
      "\n",
      "First I called my insurance and claimed this was family planning and should be provided at no cost to me per their summary of benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "\" This health plan covers family planning services furnished by a Community Health Center, General Hospital, Physician, Nurse Practitioner or Nurse Midwife. These covered services include: Consultations, exams, procedures and medical services related to the use of all contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.Injection of birth control drugs, including the prescription drug when it is supplied by the provider during the visit. Insertion of a contraceptive implant system (such as levonorgestrel or etonogestrel), including the implant system itself. IUDs, diaphragms and other contraceptive methods that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, when the items are supplied by the provider during the visit.Genetic counseling.\"It should be free right? It's right there in their explanation. But no, they claimed it wasn't billed as family planning, and there's no IUD billed. I tried to explain they could not insert it due to anatomical reasons, but all they could say is that I need to talk to my provided and have them change their billing codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next I call the provider billing number. They open a claim without hearing much of my explanation. Someone from billing checks the records and the notes from the appointment and determines it was billed correctly. I get a letter on the mail saying they will not change the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I call back the insurance company and say they won't change the billing codes but it's still family planning related regardless and that it should be covered. They say this wasn't a normal procedure for IUD insertion. I tell her that the summary of benefits does not specify a list of procedures considered \"normal\" and if that she could give me a list or direct me to where it says specifically what's covered.. She couldn't and yet, she still wouldn't do anything for me.\n",
      "\n",

      "I started taking tri-sprintec at 18 to help with my horrible periods, and it was perfect for me. However, I found out after a few years on it that I shouldn't have been prescribed it due to my migraines with aura. So, I switched to norethindrone. It made me incredibly sick and I was so miserable that I preferred my horrible periods over being on that pill. I have major anxiety surrounding medical procedures, so an IUD/impant/shot are out of the question for me, and because I need the hormones to regulate my period and prevent me from becoming incapacitated once a month, I'm skeptical that any of those hormones would work for me anyway.\n",

      "I almost gave up hope, until at my last OB appointment she told me about Slynd. Super fascinating, its the only new progesterone only pill to be introduced in the market in over 50 years. And, its unique because it uses the type of progesterone that is typically used in combo pills (which I'm not allowed to take) rather than the type usually used in mini pills (which make me horribly sick). It works PERFECTLY and I was so thrilled to find a solution.\n",

Even with whatever magic my OB tried to work at the pharmacy, I still had to pay nearly $100 for 3 packs last time.

However, I forgot that I used to suffer bad headaches from it, serious skin irritation, and massive weight gain. It’s almost not worth it. So, I called my doctors office to get an IUD. \n",
      "\n",
      "They made me fill out a form that required me calling my healthcare insurer and asking a series of ___COVERAGE___ questions.

I called my doctors office and they told me they won’t bill my prescription insurance or allow me to have one shipped to them.

      "I very rarely post on Reddit, so consider this an example of how those with good experiences often just move on with their lives rather than post extensive horror stories online :) The reason I’m posting now is because I consulted this subreddit before my IUD replacement today and many of the posts I read scared me so much that I spent my whole week terrified of my appointment. I found one or two posts that didn’t seem so bad, and I clung to them. Hopefully this post might do that for someone else! \n",

      "I’ve avoided hormonal BC my whole life, out of an abundance of caution, due to my mother’s history of breast cancer. So I knew that the copper IUD, with its lack of hormones and its 12 year lifespan, was an awesome option for me. I got my first copper IUD 5 years ago in the UK (a Nova-T 380, with a 5-year lifespan). Before that appointment, I did the same thing and researched people’s experiences extensively online. The results were horrifying, as many of you have probably seen. I’m honestly amazed that I didn’t cancel the appointment ahead of time — I was losing my mind with fear of the pain I might experience. I spent the morning before that insertion listening to music that made me feel happy and calm on repeat. I tried as hard as I could to stay in that mindset during the appointment as well. Amazingly, I felt almost no pain during my procedure. It felt about as uncomfortable as a pap smear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I replaced that Nova-T copper IUD with a ParaGard copper IUD. Despite having a good experience the first time, I again scared myself shitless before this appointment by reading experience stories online. If anything, I think I was more scared before this second appointment, because I was convinced that I just got lucky the first time, and now with a different IUD, I’d finally experience the searing, screaming pain everyone was talking about. I barely slept last night and started crying once I got into the gynecologist’s ___OFFICE___ :( \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, my removal &amp; reinsertion went totally fine! The same mild discomfort of a pap smear was there due to the speculum, and at various points I definitely felt an odd kind of discomfort that was a little harder to tolerate. I felt slightly lightheaded. But I kept expecting a kind of stabbing burst of pain, and that never came. It is a difficult feeling to describe... a combination of a bit of pressure, a kind of prickly feeling, and a tightness/pinching sensation deep inside my body. But it was low in intensity and completely manageable for the short time I had to deal with it. I’d say it was a similar kind of pain as going to the dentist and having them floss your teeth. Wouldn’t exactly want to do it every day, but it was nowhere near a level of making me scream or cry. Maybe I’d rate it a 3 on a scale of 1-10?\n",

I took the day off of work and have been sitting on the couch with a heating pad watching TV, but honestly have felt no cramping at all since my appointment. Still feels pretty nice to chill out after the emotional trauma of the last few days, though! \n",

      "- Take 800mg of ibuprofen about 1 hour before your appointment\n",
      "- Ask for lidocaine gel on your cervix (not the injection. I also was told by my gynecologist that studies have shown the gel doesn’t actually help reduce pain, so she was a little reluctant to do it, but it is quick and easy to do and helped my anxiety, if nothing else)\n",
      "- Make a playlist of a couple of happy, relaxing songs with steady beats, and listen to it on repeat before (and during) your appointment\n",
      "- Make a list of the reasons you chose this for yourself and why you’re proud of yourself for doing this\n",

      "\n",
      "I started using hormonal birth control when I was 15 y/o (23 now) because I was sexually active and wanted to prevent pregnancy.  I've used three different methods so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate):\n",
      "   * My first method and the method that I used for the longest period of time (about 6 years)\n",
      "   * I chose it because I was young and didn't want to remember to take a pill everyday.  It was recommended to me by a friend of a friend who also used it.  I did not do really any research on the shot before getting it and the only thing that I knew was that it was a *progestin only* method\n",
      "   * On the shot:  I had no period, minimal weight gain, rare acne/break outs, no cramps, and my mood/sex drive stayed the same as far as I could tell.  Really had no complications and it was very effective for me aka never got pregnant.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The depo was a great birth control method for me personally but it is not for everyone.  I actually recommended it to my friend because I had such a great experience with it and she had a terrible experience.  I stopped using depo as my method because there were scary stories of infertility and bone density problems with prolonged use and even though my doctor tried to reassure me that those things were not necessarily things that I should worry about with the depo because I was healthy and it was working for me, I still wanted to change my method.  I remember wanting something \"less intense\" because I was no longer in a relationship and wasn't having sex at the time.  I also think that I thought that I wanted my fertility to \"come back\" just incase I wanted to get pregnant soon, ha.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* Microgestin FE (norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol):\n",
      "   * My second method of birth control that I used for less than a year.  It's a combination bill with both *progestin and estrogen* in it.\n",
      "   * I chose this method simply because planned parenthood recommended it.\n",
      "   * My period started right away with the first pack so I was surprised that my period had \"come back\" so soon after being on the depo for so long.  The periods only lasted for a few days and were just sort of typical.  I had no acne or weight gain.  I did have a lot of nausea and mood changes, I was emotional and irritable all the time while on this pill.  I also had an increase in sex drive while on the pill compared to the depo.  \n",
      "   * They tried to change me to a lower dose after the nausea and mood changes and it did help a little bit but at that point it was just kind of annoying to take the pill everyday and I was over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually went back to the depo for about 6 months after trying out the pill but then switched again.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Kyleena IUD (levonorgestrel):\n",
      "   * This is my current method of birth control and I've had it for just over a year.  \n",
      "   * I chose this method of birth control because it lasts for 5 years and it seemed even more convenient than the depo was.  Also, I heard that it was a *progestin only* method like the depo which had worked so well for me for so long and I thought that it was the same.  \n",
      "   * Good things:  no period again like with the depo, actually have been slowly losing weight (but this could be related to diet/exercise changes), not pregnant \n",
      "   * Not so good things:  about 1 month after starting kyleena I started getting horrible acne (not only on my face but also on my neck, back, chest, etc).  I thought it would go away, it hasn't.  The acne actually has been so severe that I've now had to use prescriptions meds to try and treat but its not really helping.  Also, my hair has changed a lot.  In places where I always have had hair (legs, armpits, etc) now have more hair that is thicker, darker, and comes back faster than before.  In places where I used to have maybe a little peach fuzz like my stomach or even my butt are now also getting darker and thicker.  All while the hair on my head is falling out like crazy and is much thinner.  \n",
      "   * I've also noticed that my body temperature runs higher now, like when i go to the doctors ___OFFICE___ (frequently for the last year because of the acne) my temperature is always around 99.2f but before I always ran more like 97.9-98.2f .  I'm not sure if this is related or not but... the information is there\n",
      "\n",
      "So its been a little more than a year now that I've struggled with these side effects of Kyleena and they weren't so bad in the beginning when I could convince myself that they were temporary and would go away but now they do not feel temporary.  I've been feeling a little desperate lately with the kyleena and I've been asking myself a lot of questions about why the depo, which is also a progestin only method, was so good to me but the kyleena isn't... and I finally (late I know considering I've been on hormonal birth control for like 8 years now) decided to start doing some real research about these methods to find out whats in them, why they work, and how they work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting (in my opinion) information:  \n",
      "\n",
      "* the hormones in hormonal iuds are the same hormones that are in the plan b pills \n",
      "* there are actually a few different kinds of synthetic progesterone (progestin) and estrogen... I thought there was only one kind, hence why I thought that the kyleena was the same as the depo just longer lasting.  They are NOT the same.  \n",
      "   * each of the different kinds has a different response in the body based on the size and shape of the synthetic particle and where it binds in the body\n",
      "   * medroxyprogesterone acetate and levonorgestrel are both progestins but they are different in where they come from and how the bind to receptors in the body which changes how other hormones in the body, like androgens for example, are released or stored.  They both work to prevent pregnancy though in essentially the same way by preventing ovulation and changing the thickness of the lining.  \n",
      "* high androgen levels can be triggered by certain synthetic hormones, but in my case the hormones in the iud\n",
      "   * high androgen levels can cause things like:  acne, oily skin, hair thinning/balding on the scalp, male pattern hair growth (aka dark, thick hair all over), no periods or irregular periods, polycystic ovary syndrome (interesting bc they say there's a risk for ovarian cysts with hormonal iuds), and in some people high levels can cause changes in sex drive\n",
      "   * the hormones in the depo can cause androgen changes sometimes too depending on the person but its much less likely than with the iud hormones\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think that my body just does not react well to the levonorgestrel form of progestin and now I am considering having my iud removed (maybe not replacing it with any kind of hormonal birth control) and just praying that my skin and hair go back to normal.  I am a little worried though what my period would be like without birth control though because it was weird before I ever used birth control... Every person is different in how they react to different medications and methods and you can't trust everything you read on the internet obviously so I have a lot of things to ask my gyno about before making any decisions but at least I have a better idea of this whole hormone mess and I don't feel like I am making decisions based on the experiences of other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "While doing some of my research I came across this website called [helloclue.com](https://helloclue.com) that I had never heard of before and I know that its not a doctor but they have a lot of information about a lot of really interesting topics and their articles are all heavily sourced and sited so I feel comfortable with the information that they provide.

I kept trying to incorporate my husband into the conversation but the doctor never took his attention away from me and what I want to do with my body. My husband curiously asked about IUD's, not because he wanted me to get one but because we had been discussing them previously and both had questions about some things we read, and the doctor answered his question and then said \"but that's not what she wants so that's not what we're going to do\" and turned back to me. \n",

I find it to be stupid because I’ve done my research and have better shit to do than sit around in a doctor’s ___OFFICE___. Plus I found it unprofessional that the receptionist asked if I was sure I wanted it done. I told her I’ve been doing research for months. Along with this, my mom has been trying to police what I do with my body because she worries that the IUD will make me infertile. I gave her articles that refute that claim but I think she just likes to tell me what to do. First she wouldn’t let me dye my hair, then she tells me not to get tattoos, and now she’s telling me what birth control I can and can’t use because she wants to be a grandma. I’ve told her many times that I don’t want kids but she won’t accept it. Plus she knows my nuvaring is making me depressed but she wants me to stay on it.

I still HIGHLY recommend this method to anyone who will listen, even tho it did fail for me, twice. The lesson to be taken out of this experience is this: if you know something is wrong, don’t listen to someone who tells you otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get into it. It’s going to be long. I have been on many many types of birth control. To name the first few I started when I was 13? Mini pill, pill, Nuvaring, Skyla, mirena, depo shot but pill form, and now the nexplanon. 7 forms. And I’m now only 18. I’m gonna start by saying, you’ve probably guessed, but I didn’t use BC as a pregnancy preventative. I used it like a medication. I’m gonna go into detail about my first IUD. I got the Skyla put it by my primary care doctor and it was painful. I will not lie, it’s painful. But I have a very high pain tolerance and bit through the pain. About 2 months having the IUD put in, I knew something wasn’t right. I was about 14 at the time, and I knew something wasn’t right because the strings were protruding out of my vagina. Yes. Those short strings that are supposed to stay up tucked by the cervix were in fact, now poking right out of my entrance. I called up my Gyno and they got me in and they took a look and said, nope you’re fine BUT just in case. Let’s take a look via ultrasound. They did and now and behold, my iud was in the process of just. Shimmeying it’s way right out of my nether regions. It was sitting very low in the uterus and embedded itself right at the opening. Gyno took one look at it was like “ooooo shit. That’s coming out right. Now.” So they pull those abnormally large strings and say “well. Let’s get you a mirena!” Cool! I get the mirena put in same day and everything looks good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward three years. I’m now sexually actively and I’m LOVING the convenience of the mirena. But it’s not doing it for me anymore. My periods are still heavy and I’m still in mass amounts of pain every damn cycle and I can’t live my life like that. So I go back to the Gyno and they agree, so they double me up. I then start taking medroxyprogestragoneacetate or something. Fancy talk for the depo shot but pill form. And then it just goes downhill. I notice my first period on the pill is Easy and light. Brown blood for 3 days and I’m done. I stop bleeding for like 4 days and then. It’s back. And I think, “huh. Odd”. And it’s actually blood. And then I go out of town for two weeks. And it’s getting increasingly worse and they said it was supposed to stop my bleeding? Not make it worse? So I call my Gyno and get forwarded to a nurse who said “oh it’s fine. You’re good. I’ll talk to the Gyno for you but you’re fine.” And I don’t believe her. I wait 3 more days (still on vacation) and I tell the nurse this time something is wrong, and I’m doubling up and taking two pills a day. And she says “okay. Whatever. You still don’t need to talk to the Gyno. You’re fine. See you whenever” and hangs up. So I get back from vacation,now loading a lot of hormone into my body and I just have this feeling. Something not right. This isn’t normal. After the 4 weeks of bleeding I get worried. This isn’t supposed to happen. And I check my strings one day in the shower and lo and behold, I feel a hard nub. I have my boyfriend feel my hard nub. I feel the hard nub 20 more times to make sure. That hard nub is my iud falling out. So the first thing I do is I take my ass right back to a different Gyno and have her look for .2 seconds and tell me “nope. I don’t see it. You’re fine”. But!! Tell me that the new birth control I was taking shouldn’t be making me bleed. And send me on my way. I payed $75 bucks to have her tell me I’m wrong? And come back in 2 weeks and have an ultrasound down? And if I’m worried, to not have sex, what is this? This isn’t birth control, this is my medication and it’s falling out of me! I need help! But I have to wait 3 more days because of the New Years. And then I call my Gyno up like “hey. This is the deal. What can y’all do for me” and they say “oh haha just don’t have sex, and come in 3 WEEKS!!!! From now. We will get you in for an ULTRASOUND to check!” No. Absolutely not. I already had one doctor tell me to wait. I had a nurse write me off as dramatic over the phone. I know I’m right and I need the help now. I’ve been bleeding at this point for over a month and a half. What’s going on. So I over exaggerate a bit and say that it’s causing a lot of pain and I need it removed. Oh! What’s this? An appointment in 20 minutes! That just randomly popped up outta nowhere!! Lemme get you in. So I hop in my car, strut right up to that appointment and I tell them my problems. Now the Gyno is a little “eh”. But against her wishes, checks. And what does she find?\n",

She then apologizes for not getting back to me when I called the ___OFFICE___ twice early on as “the nurse took care of it for her” and then told me, I am no longer allowed to use an IUD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, after 3 successful years with my mirena, my body decided to randomly shove it out of my system and I didn’t get proper help for it till a week after initially feeling the nub. And before that, over a month when I was randomly bleeding.\n",

      "Let me start by saying, I live in the US and my health insurance has a high deductible of $1,500 a year that resets at the end of the year. So needless to say, I avoid any medical care unless it's free or I'm dying, specially at the end of the year because I know if I end up spending any money towards my deductible it will reset soon. With that being said, I do get a free Routine Preventive Physical Exam, and a free Routine Gynecological exam a year so I always take advantage of it. Additionally, anything related to Family Planning comes at no cost to me. So it's fair to say that I should be able to get the IUD for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "It all started when I needed a re-fill for my birth control pills prescription. I called the doctor's ___OFFICE___ and they said that in order to get a re-fill I needed to come in for a check-up because I had not gone this year. So I went ahead and scheduled an appointment with whomever could see me first. This was in December and I got an appointment for January.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was seen by a PA. At the appointment I mentioned that I was interested in trying an IUD instead of continuing with the pill. She said if I wanted, it can be done during this appointment. It didn't have much time to think about it but I figured since this appointment was free and another one might not be, I might as well do it then, so I agreed to have it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I signed some paperwork and she proceeded to get an IUD. I wasn't given any options to choose but I was able to see the package that said Kyleena.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Mirena, Kyleena is smaller and has smaller dose of hormones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I later read that they are supposed to test for STDs and pregnancy before attempting to insert an IUD and they did not do either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without not being too TMI here, there are a few steps for inserting and IUD:\n",
      "\n",
      "First the insert the speculum, similar to when they do a pap smear. This is uncomfortable, but didn't feel too bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, they clean your cervix with a solution to prevent any infection. Painless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she proceeds to stabilize my cervix with a tenaculum. Yeah that's as painful as it sounds. She warns me that I'm gonna feel a 'pinch'. It felt like the worst cramp I've ever had but it was brief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she use a tool called 'sound' to check for the length and direction of the cervical canal. It needs a reading of at least 6cm to avoid going too deep and perforating your uterus with the IUD insertion kit. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is when things got tough, she was getting a reading of just 3cm. She tried a few things, probably moving the tenaculum as I felt the 'pinch' a few more times and trying to dilate the cervix, and got to 4cm but couldn't get the the minimum requirement of 6cm. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is when she decided to get help from her attending physician. He then stepped in, tried it himself &lt;insert 'pinch' here yet again&gt; and said \"you weren't joking\" when he could not get a higher reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, probably from looking at my [\"Hide the pain Hardold\"](https://i.imgflip.com/1cf8by.jpg)  expression, they gave up.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left the room and then the PA came back and told me we can try again at another appointment, this time with an assisted insertion to be able to see the uterus. My first question of course was \"Will the insurance cover it?\" to which she has no idea and suggested I asked the person making the appointment at the front desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went to make the appointment, this time I requested my actual OBGYN since it seemed like it would be better to have an experienced doctor instead of a PA. When asking about my insurance the lady said: \"yeah you're insurance should cover it\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Spoiler alert, my insurance did cover it, but that doesn't mean I didn't have to pay… This is how I learned the real meaning of the word coverage when it comes to insurance. Covered means they'll process it, it doesn't necessarily means they'll pay for it, specially if you have a deductible that hasn't been met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, it's now January, and my deductible is at 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day of the appointment my doctor calls me and ask that I go early for an ultrasound before she sees me to check for any abnormalities that might be preventing the IUD from being inserted. Made sense to me so I followed her advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did a pelvic and vaginal ultrasound. The ultrasounds didn't show anything abnormal. So when I actually go see her she couldn't understand how they couldn't insert the IUD before, so she's determined to give it a try herself before trying the assisted insertion. Lather, rinse and repeat, or more like, insert, pinch and repeat (ouch). No luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then we prepare for a hysteroscopy, which it's kind of like a endoscopy but of the uterus. Basically inserting a camera in there. This is used for surgery but in my case it was only exploratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "After putting anesthesia (another pinch, with a needle this time), they fill me up with water and insert a camera inside me. I was able to see on the screen what my doctor was seeing.\n",

      "Funny enough.. she couldn't find my cervix opening at all. She even said \"You get your period right? You must have a cervix opening then but I can't find it\". It looked like it diverted in two paths. She would follow one, and it would lead nowhere. She would go back, follow the other path, lead nowhere either. I saw it all, and was puzzled by it too. After trying a few times, she gave up. She told me she was going to consult with someone to read my ultrasound and verify what could be the cause.\n",

These covered services include: Consultations, exams, procedures and medical services related to the use of all contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.Injection of birth control drugs, including the prescription drug when it is supplied by the provider during the visit. Insertion of a contraceptive implant system (such as levonorgestrel or etonogestrel), including the implant system itself. IUDs, diaphragms and other contraceptive methods that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, when the items are supplied by the provider during the visit.Genetic counseling.\"It should be free right? It's right there in their explanation. But no, they claimed it wasn't billed as family planning, and there's no IUD billed. I tried to explain they could not insert it due to anatomical reasons, but all they could say is that I need to talk to my provided and have them change their billing codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next I call the provider billing number. They open a claim without hearing much of my explanation. Someone from billing checks the records and the notes from the appointment and determines it was billed correctly. I get a letter on the mail saying they will not change the bill.\n",

      "I call back the insurance company and say they won't change the billing codes but it's still family planning related regardless and that it should be covered. They say this wasn't a normal procedure for IUD insertion. I tell her that the summary of benefits does not specify a list of procedures considered \"normal\" and if that she could give me a list or direct me to where it says specifically what's covered.. She couldn't and yet, she still wouldn't do anything for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what now? I'm at dead end and the only way out was to just pay the bill. I guess if i'm gonna have to pay, I can at least try is to negotiate it down as many people claim they successfully do. Nope, they refused to give me any discounts because I have insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire experience was very frustrating. Next time I need a medical visit or procedure or test I will be requesting cost estimates and checking with my insurance BEFOREHAND, and getting it in writing. Still, I know even that wont ensure that that's what I'll end up paying at the end.\n",
      "\n",

      "Marked as rant because that is exactly what this is! I'm so frustrated and angry right now. I get my birth control 4 times a year, three packs at a time. I was moving in August so I went to my doc in July and get my BC taken cared of for the year and change my address. Well, that was all fine and dandy and I got my first three months no problem. Three months later I'm expecting my next set and were getting close to the end of my last pack- it never showed. It took 4 days to get the doctors ___OFFICE___ and the pharmacy on the same page and I was doing ALL the leg work. Turned out my doctor wrote my perception to take 'as needed' and it needed to say 'take daily' so the pharmacy wouldn't fill it. They got it fixed and the pharmacy speed shipped it to me. Three months later I forgot I was on my last pack and when I went to go grab another, there were none left. I never recieved my next set so I'm scrambling trying to figure out what to do because I did the deed that morning and need to take my first pill of the month. Call the doctors ___OFFICE___. They forgot to send my refill. They forgot about my medication that I need to take on a daily basis to avoid becoming pregnant. The only solution they offer is to ask a doctor on site to write an emergency prescription for me to pick up same day at the Walgreens right next to me. My doctor wasn't there so they asked a male doctor and he said he wouldn't do it without me coming in for an appointment. This is impossible because I moved far away and was 100% the reason why I wanted to get this all taken care of before I moved. Called the pharmacy to see if they could ship my set next day and they said the earliest I could have it would be January 21st because the refill was just sent that day (because I called asking about it). This is the second time my doctor ___OFFICE___ has fucked up and this time its causing me to go without my prescription for a month (because I won't be able to start in the middle of a pack when I receive it, I'm told I have to start right after a cycle which I just finished Saturday).

I don't usually experience cramps or back pain and I'm very psychosomatic, so that would explain my moodiness. (the IUD is nonhormonal, so that would not be the cause). My body is likely adjusting to having the IUD in me so I expected things to be a little different. \n",

I took some ibuprofen with lunch at 12:00 at work and left for my appointment. My appointment was at 1:00, got to the ___OFFICE___ at 12:45, checked in, was told to leave a urine sample to prove I'm not pregnant (though I was on the last day of my period because they told me that it helps if I go in on my period). They took me back to the room where all the STUFF was just out on the counter, which I tried to not look at. They took my blood pressure, confirmed I was there for the ParaGard IUD, and instructed me to undress my bottom half and wait for the midwife (I see a midwife in an OBGYN practice-- she is amazing!). \n",
      "\n",
      "My midwife came in, we chitchatted for a second, recapped why I chose the ParaGard (I get very anxious about the idea of not having a period, I'm anxious about hormones, mainly) and then went through the consent form and all the stuff she has to tell me about the effectiveness, statistics for expulsions or other complications, that sort of stuff. I signed my soul away and we got to business.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The insertion!**\n",
      "\n",
      "I was VERY nervous, but like I said, my midwife is the BEST and really helped calm my anxieties mostly by keeping me talking. I highly recommend just talking throughout the whole thing to take your brain off of it a little. One thing that I have never read on anyone's insertion experiences *ever* is that I was provided a heating pad!!! It was such a nice, comforting touch and I really appreciated it. So she broke the chemical pack in the heating pad and told me to lay back and place it on my lower abdomen as I do for cramps. It was a great touch, probably helped to distract from the weird sensations of the procedure, and was super calming. I HIGHLY recommend bringing a heating pad because I do think it helped me if not physically at least mentally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway-- the beginning of the procedure is just like a pelvic exam. Legs in stirrups, speculum in, and the procedure at my doctor's ___OFFICE___ is to do a chlamydia test while they're in there, so she did the swab for the chlamydia test (which feels just like a pap smear) and then told me that the next step was to stabilize the uterus. She had me cough so she could grab onto it or whatever she had to do, which to me was one of the more unpleasant parts of the procedure, actually. It is hard to describe how it feels, but you are very aware of your uterus and it's crampy, but not sharp pain. Just super uncomfortable. Then she cleaned the uterus with iodine which just feels cold and unpleasant but not painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the part I was dreading: the Uterine Sound (to measure your uterus and open 'er up for the IUD). My doctor was letting me know every step of the way what was going on but also had me keep talking about my pain management meditation methods I guess to keep me a little distracted lol. It was honestly *not that bad*. She inserted the sound slowly and gently and it wasn't the blinding pain I was anticipating. It was just really intense cramping, and I tried to focus on the warmth of the heating pad and meditating in the discomfort. She told me that I measured 8 centimeters from the cervix to back of uterus because I practically demand doctors tell me any information they find about my body because I like it. She left the sound in for a minute, which was weird and I didn't really hear about anyone else having this happen, but I assume to let my uterus relax and stay a little more open, and she was also putting on sterile gloves and preparing the IUD for insertion. I was still rattling on about whatever I was talking about at this point. Then she removed the sound and inserted the IUD pretty swiftly one after the other and it all kind of felt the same-- uncomfortable but not unbearable. I'd say a 5/10 on the pain scale, honestly. I've had diarrhea pains where I was sitting moaning on the toilet convinced I was going to die 5X more painful than the IUD insertion experience, but I'd say the general vibe is actually really similar to painful gas/diarrhea cramps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worst part was when she was removing the tube thing for the IUD I guess my uterus started clamping down on the tube so she kinda had to be yanking on it which was a little painful. Then, she trimmed the strings. kind of right after the IUD was inserted and before she started trimming the strings my legs started shaking a lot. My midwife said that was actually really common-- just adrenaline pumping through my system in response to a foreign invader. I was just nervous I was making her job hard. As soon as she trimmed the strings she started removing the stabilizer tool and the speculum and I was able to take my legs out of the stirrups while she cleaned up and lie down with my heating pad. We continued to chitchat and she told me again what to expect: spotting/bleeding, come in in 4 weeks for a string check, my periods will be more painful and heavier for 3-6 months but should normalize after that, etc. I was not feeling any immediate cramping, maybe I was, but I was mostly shocked it didn't hurt as much as it did, proud that I didn't pass out, and excited that I did it after much deliberation and putting the appointment off, so I probably didn't notice the cramping. \n",
      "\n",
      "She told me I was all set but to lie down for as long as I wanted until I felt comfortable getting up and going home. I laid down for maybe 10 minutes because I was nervous I'd get like a delayed reaction to the trauma or something and pass out but I just kind of scrolled twitter and texted my boyfriend an update (he was out of town on a work thing) and gingerly stood up, felt good, got dressed, and left. I drove myself home, feeling pretty good, took some more ibuprofen and put in a new pad in case I started bleeding for good measure, and watched some TV. I drank a couple of beers to take the edge off which honestly helped, I think. Not that I condone alcohol as a coping mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say the rest of the day I was feeling what I'd classify as medium period cramps. I made sure to eat some dinner, took some last ibuprofen before bed, and cuddled up with a heating pad. \n",
      "\n",
      "**The next day: Saturday**\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked to wake up from the cramping pain since I was doing fine the day before, but I think the day before I had been on top of the ibuprofen game and it had all worn off by morning. I texted my boyfriend to verify his red eye got in last night and he was alive, and he said he was on the way with food. We cuddled in bed and I ate my McDonalds breakfast, ate some ibuprofen, and felt yucky. I'd classify it as medium to hard period cramps. I just couldn't get comfortable. Once the painkillers kicked in, I was feeling much better, and we played overcooked for a few hours before I felt like going for a walk, so we walked to the diner. I think walking helps a lot. I was feeling fine, re-upped my ibuprofen, and I decided I felt up to meeting a group of my friends for the Bill's game at a bar downtown. So we drove downtown, I was out until about 8:00 when I just kinda felt tired, we went back to my place, made out a bit, and actually almost had sex but I was wigged out about my new implant friend and what sex the first time is going to be like so I hard passed on that one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, day 1 post-insertion was not bad as long as I stayed on top of ibuprofen-- I could tell when it was starting to wear off because I became conscious of my cramping, but then if I took more ibuprofen the discomfort mostly left. Shockingly, I didn't really bleed much at all-- just some spotting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Today: Sunday**\n",
      "\n",
      "All-day today was fine! I started bleeding but nothing too heavy. No major cramps, though-- just had ibuprofen in the morning and nothing else all day and I've been fine, but it's also been a bit of a lazy day. Went to Lush and treated myself to some new soap for being brave. \n",

      "After months of research and asking all of my friends about their birth control experiences, I finally went for it and got a Skyla IUD inserted last week. It's been 8 days since I got it and it's definitely more uncomfortable than I was anticipating, but it is SO NICE to not have to worry every time I have sex. I have been keeping track of my symptoms and I'm really curious if this is abnormal or if anyone else has had similar experiences. For background, I haven't taken BC pills for 3+ years, and when I did take them it was only for about 6 months b/c I didn't like the side effects. Also, my periods have traditionally been really straight forward and not terrible. Usually, I have mild cramps the first day and my heaviest bleeding is on the second day. It usually is pretty manageable and only lasts 4-5 days. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a day by day explanation of my experience thus far: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 1 (Insertion):** It was the last day of my period and my doctor gave me misoprostol to soften my cervix, which I inserted the night before I went. On the day of, I made an exerted effort to drink a lot of water and I took 800 MG of Ibuprofen about 45 minutes before insertion. The actual time in the ___OFFICE___ was only about 15-20 minutes, and the insertion was more of a discomfort than actually painful if that makes sense. I had some intense cramping right after for about 5 minutes and I felt light-headed, but I was relatively fine compared to what I was expecting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 2:** The cramps were still bad, but definitely not constant and I was glad to be WFH. I took pain relievers and used my heating pad and it was manageable. I had a little bit of spotting this day, which was to be expected. I felt good enough to have sex (x3) and I was momentarily obsessed with the IUD b/c it's just so convenient! I noticed that I looked much more bloated than normal and started to feel gassy, but I figured it was something I ate (not sure why I didn't associate it with the IUD--duh).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 3:** Cramps were pretty similar to what I experienced in days prior, but this day I started to feel the strings poking around down there!! Super odd feeling and I was taken off guard, but from my research, it seems like that is normal and they will hopefully soften a bit the longer they are in. I experienced a really painful bout of cramps in the evening for about 30 minutes but used my heating pad to help. I also checked my strings and they are still in place, which is a positive! \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 4:** My cramp pain was not as bad this day, but I did start to notice a stronger than usual smell from my vagina (TMI, I know.) but no discharge. I had stopped spotting at this point too. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 5:** I called the doctor about the smell because I was concerned. Because it wasn't a smell I'd associate with an infection (ex: Bacterial Vaginosis) and more so a stronger smell than normal, she said that it might just be because my pH is off. This ended up clearing up within a day, thankfully. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 6:** I fell asleep for an hour and then woke up at 2 AM in extreme pain. I have a fairly high pain tolerance, but this was the worst thing I've ever experienced. Like laying on the bathroom floor crying status. It felt like I needed to poop, but couldn't (Also, I pooped at 9 PM the night prior). There was immense pressure on my stomach/lower abdomen and it felt like I was extremely gassy. I tried taking Miralax to help, but I started feeling even worse, so eventually, I went to the hospital at 4 AM. The hospital gave me an IV and ran tests on me, including urine analysis, blood work, and a CT scan. They gave me anti-nausea meds and bentyl, and it did help me, but I didn't feel 100% better. Also, I was convinced I was constipated because that's what it felt like, but according to the CT scan, the IUD is in the correct place and there is no colon blockage (Yay?). I went home around 8 AM and rested for the rest of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 7:** I was feeling pretty bloated and felt that same pressure/need to poop as I have before so I took some of the bentyl they prescribed. I feel cramps on and off and I had a really bad migraine all day. I took two doses of Miralax this day b/c I hadn't had a bowel movement in two days. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Day 8:** Another migraine and more cramping. I also started spotting again. The highlight of the day is that I finally pooped (x3)  so mentally, I was relieved. I thought that would fix all of my problems, but sadly I still feel kinda crappy (pun intended). I'm starting to get used to the cramping and pain, but I'm nervous that it's a sign of something larger. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone have a similar experience or have thoughts on what I should do? I'm thinking that I should try to deal with the side effects for at least the next few weeks and see how my first period goes with the IUD before getting it taken out. I know that it's a foreign object in my body and I'm guessing the hormones are what is making me so bloated, but I'm just slightly scared that no one warned me it would be this bad and I have no idea how long it'll last. It makes me nervous that these symptoms are warning signs the IUD is going to expel and I'm driving myself crazy about it. I have a follow-up appointment on 11/18 where they are going to do an ultrasound and make sure everything looks correct, but in the meantime, I'd appreciate any insight.

My first period was on time, but my period this month is now 4/5 days late. I have a history of irregular periods, but it’s been a while since I’ve been late. For the past week and a half it seems I’ve had brown discharge, like old blood. Nothing out of the normal, just a little concerned with how long I’ve been having it. It’s a mix of watery and very sticky. However, the past day or so there’s been some pinkish discharge/blood as well. A very faint amount. Barely noticeable. I just felt for my IUD string, found it no problem. This is the first time I’ve felt it myself, earlier in the month I had my boyfriend check since I didn’t feel I could get at the right angle. I haven’t had sex in nearly 3 weeks, but the last time I did was unprotected and during my ovulation time frame without pulling out. I’m not experiencing any cramping. I recently started a new job which requires more physical activity than I had been doing. I’ve also been extremely stressed lately and going through a major depressive episode since my seasonal depression is kicking in. My diet/eating habits have changed recently due to this as well.

      "\n",
      "A little detour to describe my particular period problems: I started my period when I was 10 years old, which is considered old in my family. My first period lasted about twenty days, but it wasn't particularly heavy yet—the start of every period afterwards was exactly 31 days apart, mostly to the hour, and bleeding lasted 9 to 16 days. I would have to change my pad every 30ish minutes the first four days, and then every hour or two until the bleeding stopped. Cramps were always super painful and near-constant, sometimes to the point of throwing up, but my doctors didn't want to put me on birth control at that age. Instead I was told to take three ibuprofen every four hours, and prescribed iron pills for my worsening anemia. This was my norm until I turned 14, and my periods suddenly became irregular—I had a pap smear, it was normal, and I was finally prescribed different birth controls until one didn't make me vomit profusely. That birth control ended up being Nora-BE, which I was on for about two years before I stopped for reasons I honestly can't remember. My periods were never really regular again, however, and I've just learned to live with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Current Symptoms**\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm 19 now, and started Nora-BE again in mid-2020 because I began developing ovarian cysts that were bursting and sending me to the hospital. That and I am now in a relationship with a man, so I want protection. Another big reason for continuing Nora-BE was that I was recently diagnosed with Factor V Leiden, a blood clotting disorder that rules out all medications with estrogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into the doctor's on September 15 for complaints about worsening cramps (impressive, I know), pain and nausea during/after sex, uterine pain when (TMI) straining to go to the bathroom (TMI), and generalized, constant non-uterine abdominal pain when on my period. My mom and her mom both had endometriosis—my mom required a full hysterectomy and removal of part of her bladder and intestines due to tissue growth, as well as blood transfusions because she hemorrhaged. My grandmother wasn't ever able to get real treatment other than a diagnosis, and a full hysterectomy when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and it was discovered (surprise) her endometriosis was significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor I saw on the 15th, predictably, didn't want to diagnose or test me for endo because, in his eyes, I was too young for invasive surgery (false—I've had them in the past) and my symptoms weren't \"clinically significant.\" Even when I pointed out it's been almost 10 years with no real improvement in symptoms, he just suggested getting the Skyla IUD and told me it would be the most I'd get from the appointment. I just agreed to try the IUD, since I had and have no other options at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Post-Insertion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Insertion didn't even hurt, and I had been bleeding for five days at that point. The thing is, the bleeding hasn't stopped—it's been 40 days as of October 27, and every time I change my pad I'm greeted with mostly dark brownish-black clots. It literally looks like my insides are just sloughing off, more so than I'm menstruating. The level of bleeding has fluctuated randomly from what I assume is spotting (light for me, at least) to my regular heaviness. My cramps are somehow worse, but they don't make me nauseous at least, and I haven't thrown up because of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still taking Nora-BE due to my ovarian cysts, so it would be great if I could stop bleeding to actually enjoy the benefits of both birth controls. I'm still experiencing the same symptoms as before, except I'm not sure if the pain during/after sex is still applicable because, well... I'm not into that when bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Other (Potentially) Relevant Info**\n",
      "\n",
      "I've got some other diagnoses that are potentially relevant: I have a fairly severe, but not total IgA deficiency, IBS-C, and the previously mentioned Factor V Leiden clotting disorder. I have a history of anemia, as well as dysautonomia. Medication-wise, I take Nora-BE (mentioned), venlafaxine for dysthymia, and am currently taking doxycycline for a staphylococcus UTI. **I am not pregnant.** For the love of all possible gods I'm definitely not pregnant, as I not only haven't had sex for like... two months now, but I've taken at least eleven pregnancy tests in that time via clinicians not communicating and wanting to \"rule it out\" when I come in for other complaints. I was tested for the dreaded C-virus (not because I had symptoms, but because my campus essentially requires it) and was negative. I am in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Questions**\n",
      "\n",
      "My main question is this: is persistent bleeding *actually* normal with the Skyla IUD? When I call the advice line, they tell me to ask a gynecologist, who, if they get back to me, say that \"irregular bleeding is a normal side effect.\" Not one has addressed the fact I'm asking about *persistent, non-stop bleeding*, and I don't have time for an ___OFFICE___ visit because I'm currently dealing with university chaos and moving 1000 miles. That and my insurance is unstable because of the switching process (I don't know if I'm covered until January 1st as of right now).\n",
      "\n",
      "Other questions include: are other IUDs better for people with menstrual symptoms/histories like mine? Should I even have an IUD? Is it worth it to stick the symptoms out and see if they improve within the 6 month period after insertion?\n",

Firstly, I never get my period during the placebo/iron pill week. I always get it the week before when I’m still taking hormone. I called my gynecologist’s ___OFFICE___ and spoke to a nurse who told me this wasn’t an issue. However, I’m still feeling hesitant about that. It doesn’t really seem normal, and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced a similar issue.

I felt better because the nurse told me she wasn't too alarmed but I still felt like something wasn't right. Monday comes around and I still am bleeding. I called them back, they asked the same questions which I had the same answers to, and they told me *again* not to worry but to keep an eye on things. Three days later I called again and was told that I could schedule an ultrasound for some peace of mind. \n",

      "On October 7 I came in for my ultrasound and had easily the most unpleasant experience at a gyno's ___OFFICE___ I've ever had. I was not met by my doctor, but by a callous ultrasound technician who told me repeatedly \"I have other patients to attend to\", \"I don't mean to rush you but there are other patients I need to see\" because I arrived 4 minutes late to my appointment. She pointed at the bathroom and muttered something that I did not hear. I looked at her puzzled and she pointed back at the bathroom and said \"I don't need you to fill the cup\" so I asked her what she wanted me to do and she rudely said \"go empty your bladder\". In the middle of the ultrasound she asked me \"So why are you here?\" which threw me off because I felt like she hadn't even bothered to look at my chart or speak to my doctor. I was not an expecting mother who was excited to have an ultrasound. I was a scared patient who knew that something was wrong. \n",

My gyno is truly wonderful. She is the only gyno I've ever been to and I truly trust her and admire her bedside manner, patience and intelligence. She said she was very glad that I expressed my discomfort with what happened at my ultrasound, and assured me that she would speak with her technician because the way she spoke to me was completely inappropriate. She answered all my questions, took my IUD out and showed it to me and explained how it was positioned and why it was causing the bleeding. \n",

      "Backstory: Once I started dating my now husband about 2.5 years ago I got a Nexplanon implant. It completely changed my mood and temperament, had horrible periods, and would break out in a hive over the implant on occasion. I decided to try the Kyleena IUD as my Gynecologist thought with more localized hormone control, I would have less systemic side effects.\n",

      "The insertion (which was last Wednesday) was one of the most painful experiences of my life. My Gyn told me to expect cramping for a few hours after the procedure, and period like cramps for a few weeks, but nothing terrible. On Friday, after two days of cramping that lifted me off the bed or chair with pain into my back and even vagina, making sitting intolerable, and with my husband's urging, I contacted my Gyn ___OFFICE___. They wanted me to come in right away. They checked the position of the IUD, and it was fine. They gave me some gabapentin to take 3x day for 10 days, and I was to contact them if the cramps/pain continued. I continued to have some cramping, but much less...until this morning. The pain woke me out of my sleep and was just as bad, if not worse, than before taking the gabapentin. I loaded up on the gabapentin, NSAIDs, and tylenol with no pain relief. I know alot of ladies on here have said to expect some cramping for a few weeks to a few months after insertion, but if y'all had the cramps and pain I had and continued to live a normal life, then you are MUCH stronger than  I, lol. My Gyn ended up removing the Kyleena, and I felt an instant relief of pressure. I still have slight cramping, and my abs feel like I've done 1000 sit ups a day, but the pain is definitely so much less now. \n",

Over the years, I have discounted the way I have been feeling/the side effects, telling myself that it is better than getting pregnant. I have been bleeding almost constantly since about 3-4 months from my 2018 insertion, which irritates my vulva and I just went it with for so long. The bleeding began to increase a lot at the end of 2019– more clots and all. I also have IBS-C, which the systemic hormones in the Nexplanon have exacerbated. The cystic acne has been horrid— something that I have never had in my life— but I have gutted through it. I generally feel kind of blah all the time as well. There was a definite surge in anxiety very quickly after I got the implant placed.\n",

I am getting fed up with the way I am feeling, and frankly it is beginning to scare me. I was getting choked up about it with my NP.

I took both misoprostol tablets earlier in the day, as my appointment was in the afternoon, it didn't cause much cramping but I did have GI issues, which made me nervous for my appointment. I had breakfast oatmeal and a decent lunch. I took the tramadol on the way to the ___OFFICE___, in hindsight I should have also taken some Tylenol or other anti-inflammatory, this definitely helped when I took it after I got home.  \n",

Doctor decided I needed the tenaculum to dilate my cervix further, this is where I was really feeling it; pain level 8/10. Sounding was painful but only lasted a few seconds. The actual insertion, I was breathing hard and loud, like a racehorse; the kind of breathing I do in the last bit of my hard workout runs. At some points, I moaned and murmured from the pain. The whole procedure took about 5 minutes and this experience was more painful than my initial IUD.

      "3. Before any cramping though, she did have to use a speculum to hold the vagina open. She explained that this would probably be the most uncomfortable part of the procedure, and she was totally right. This was the only time I felt anything akin to pain. It was a bigger than normal metal speculum, and it definitely gave me that pinching feeling I'd felt before during pap smears. \n",

I didn't always remember to take it, but now as a working adult, I feel my schedule has largely regulated to a point that it'd be easier to remember. I'm hoping having a regular period again will also regulate my PH and put a stop to the chronic yeast infections.

I’m right in the middle of my period, which almost nonexistent. My doctor recommended Advil one hour before my appointment and that I should wear comfortable clothes/underwear because I would have some cramping after. She also said to try and take relaxing breaths and do something calming/relaxing before my appointment because being nervous might make me clench which might make any cramping worse.\n",
      "The actual procedure was really simple. There was a nurse in the room in case I passed out/threw up/needed some moral support. The gynecologist did my yearly exam first and then she put in a metal speculum. For someone who’s never had a metal speculum used on them (she said she needed to use the metal one for this because it’s bigger. Don’t know if that’s common or not) I found this to be very uncomfortable. It wasn’t cold or anything, but there’s just more pressure because it’s larger. Then she used a large cotton swab to clean whatever mucus/period blood/excess lube was there so she had a clear view to my cervix. Then she measured me to make sure she placed the IUD in the right place/far enough in. This part was most painful for me and it was just a bad cramp. Not even bad enough to make me want to hunch over or curl up, so not the worst cramp I’ve ever had. She warned me before hand that it would cramp and then she said “okay cramp in 3,2,1.” She spent maybe 10 seconds measuring and then as she pulled the sound she used to measure out she counted 3,2,1 again and the cramp stopped. She then gave me some local anesthetic. She said it might pinch a little, but I felt nothing, which is how I am with novacaine at the dentist, so not a surprise. Then she showed me the Paraguard in its insertion tube. It’s literally a little plastic thing with the IUD in the top with the “wings” (the top of the T) pushed down. That goes in, she places it, and then there’s a spot to hold and pull so the plastic tube comes off and the “wings” pop up. She said I would have another cramp that feels the same as I did with the measurement sound, but the anesthetic should make it so it’s not worse. I had no cramp at all. She counted down and I didn’t even feel it go in/plastic come out. The nurse looked at me shocked and said “wow you didn’t even flinch.” I stayed laying down for a minute while the gynecologist went over the basics: don’t put anything in my vagina for a week to prevent infection (she said odds are low, but like any procedure you don’t want to increase the odds), if I feel any sharp (like stabbing) pains I should make an emergency appointment, I should expect cramping and at the very least spotting today and possibly the next few days, and I was given her work cell phone number so I could text/call with concerns. I looked okay so the nurse stood near me while I sat up and they asked if I needed help standing or if I felt dizzy and when I said no they left the room for me to get dressed. \n",
      "That all happened about an hour and a half ago. I walked about 20 minutes to the train and am currently on my way home. I have some mild pain that feels like I ate too much and not like actual cramping. I wanted to make a post because when I was looking up info I saw mostly bad experiences and mine really wasn’t bad. I will say I have a relatively high pain tolerance, but even if it was 10x as painful as the cramp from the measuring sound I think I would’ve been fine, just probably would’ve wanted to curl up. I think it also helped that I’m not nervous at all to go to the gynecologist and actually really like and am comfortable with the doctor and nurses. It helped me feel more relaxed knowing that I trust the people I see there. I go to an ___OFFICE___ that has medical students and when the ___OFFICE___ asks I usually say yes to letting them have students observe whatever I’m having done, so like I said, I’m really not nervous to be there. Fingers crossed my good experience so far is a sign that the Paraguard won’t cause horrible cramps for my future periods!\n",

      "\n",
      "So I got the Liletta in April 2017. For the first year or so I loved it! But then around March 2018, I had a 13 day period that was heavy. It felt like my soul was leaving my body and I was changing pads out every two to three hours. After that, it took a little bit for my body to get back to normal and when I got my first period after that incident, it was extremely light. I was overjoyed! But then it got light and lighter until it was just gross brown discharge. On top of that, my periods went from 7 days to 9...and then 10...and then 11...after two years of this, I was having my “period” (essentially gross brown discharge with occasional spotting) for 13-14 days out of the month with only a 15 day break before I was back on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the past year or so I’ve been in an out of the OB, trying things like solid estrogen (both 1 and 2 mg, which did nothing for me except make my boobs super sore and make my face break out), and Lo Loestrin Fe, which completely and entirely fucked with my mental health and physical state so bad I had to get off it. So, my OB and I have finally come to the decision to remove my IUD. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t get me wrong, I love the benefits of the IUD and I think it worked wonderfully for me in many aspects of my life. However, I couldn’t STAND to have another period like that again. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I got it removed today and HOOOO Boy was I in for a treat. I naturally took some aleeve before my appointment, and then went in and got naked for my OB to take a gander at my squish mitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cue the speculum, the pressure and cramping anddddddd he couldn’t find the string. No big deal, just look around a bit. After FIVE MINUTES of moving the speculum every which angle and digging around, the nurse was like “I’m gonna go get the Kevorkian.” By this point, I was extremely uncomfortable. I felt so much cramping and pressure that I was already beginning to regret this decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m like “what the fuck is the Kevorkian and why is that going anywhere NEAR my holy grail?!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doc told me I had two choices : either we stop, he prescribes me medicine (I think muscle relaxers or some sort of intense painkiller) to take before the appointment and I go back in the next day to do it all over again, or I deal with it right here and now. I chose to deal with it since he was already up there anyways. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will say this for my OB—he really listens to me. I have never met an OB or male doctor who doesn’t just tell me what I “need” to do. He gives me my options, we talk about what each option entails, I give him my choice and then takes steps to follow through the choice I made. He is AMAZING....\n",
      "\n",
      "But goddamn if I didn’t hate his very soul when he put that Kevorkian up there. I was whining and crying like a little bitch. Imagine there’s a string attached to the inside of your belly button, and someone is pulling the string out through your vagina. And on the string is a sharp knife just slowly cutting into your insides as they go. THATS what the Kevorkian feels like. He dug around for a few more minutes and right when he was pulling it out because I was crying and at that point almost broke the nurses hand from squeezing it so hard, the little bastard of a string showed it’s face. So he went right back in there, popped it out and the show was over. Granted, I essentially had no medication besides the aleeve I took prior, but it was still a hella painful experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shaking, I had tears running down my face, I felt lightheaded and nauseous because of the stress I was under. But goddamn I was thrilled that now I’m able to have actual periods again. I am taking a break from all hormonal contraceptives in order to get my body back to normal, then I go back and weigh my options with my OB in a couple of months to see if I want to try a different birth control or get another IUD. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moral of this long and painful story :\n",
      "\n",
      "CHECK YOUR STRINGS. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when you hear “Kevorkian” in an OB ___OFFICE___, ask for the best painkillers available. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;dr : OB removed IUD, except string was coiled in. 6 minutes and an EXTREMELY painful experience later and it was out. Check your strings and when you hear “Kevorkian”, RUN.\n",

      "Hey gang, new here, but I need some support really and my husband figured I should try reddit and see if anyone had a similar experience.\n",
      "My husband and I decided to try and have a baby which meant my lovely Mirena had to go. Let me just say, I enjoy birth control. I was on depo for 5 years and never had a period (YAY) or a side effect the whole time, went off of it a year and gained a normal menstrual cycle, then had Mirena placed 2 years ago and it had been going great just like depo. When it was placed, the OB-GYN said I would have some strings coming from my cervix and it was normal. Well, months later I went to just feel for them, and couldn't... I assumed the strings coiled up inside my cervix and that was it and never got it checked. Never having an iud before, I didn't think it was a big issue.\n",
      "I had an appointment with a NP to have it removed today and I told her I have never felt the strings before. She didn't seem concerned. Then, she said \"uh, I don't see your iud\". She then took what I can only describe as pinchers and went into my uterus. She told me I would feel a slight pinch as she searched but alas, after 3 good looks, na da. NP sent me over to get an ultrasound externally and transvaginally. The ultrasound tech told me she saw a cyst on my left ovary (as I watched her label it it was about 2x the size of my ovary) so that was a fun bit of news to add.\n",
      "Back to the exam room, NP comes in and tells me the iud is \"way inside\" my uterus and sent my images to a radiologist to confirm if it is stuck (a less scary way of saying embedded I guess) and then she let me know of my \"giant\" ovarian cyst and was surprised I was able to walk and not doubled over in pain. She said if it isn't stuck, she could remove it tomorrow morning but if it is and she attempts to remove it then she could potentially put a hole in my uterus and that would, as she said, affect my ability to have children. NP also mentioned that on the ultrasound, they're not able to see the \"T\" shape of my iud like they normally can and that its abnormal. As I held back my tears I asked about the cyst being caused by my iud, NP said no that the iud probably stalled the growth of the cyst but was most likely there before my Mirena placement. NP said she would call me today with radiologist results, but didn't and when I called the ___OFFICE___ the receptionist said the radiologist would be the ones to call me when they have results so I'll probably bug them tomorrow. \n",
      "After talking to my family and my husband, I decided that regardless of the radiologist outcome, I've requested to be referred to an OB-GYN. The reason I didnt use one today was because my previous obgyn has actually left the area and when I called my dr ___OFFICE___ they said the NP wouldn't have an issue removing it.. I'm not looking for medical advice or anything, I guess I just want to know I'm not alone..\n",

      "25 F. After a year and some change of 24/7 bleeding with Nexplanon I decided to hang up the towel and swap for an IUD. I chose Kyleena because of the low dosage, and I didn't know how I would react to high daily dosages like Mirena (I use hormonal contraceptives for mood stabilization, Nexplanon did amazing with this but the daily periods were just too much).\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to Planned Parenthood. I had to take a urine sample, then was led into an ___OFFICE___ where I signed off on the surgery. I was free to undress from the waist down after the clinician's assistant left the room. I got on the large seat with the stool step and sat there until TWO clinicians came in, one to do the procedure and one to oversee it. They were super nice, awesome, and talked through every step. \n",
      "\n",
      "The lady doing the surgery inserted two fingers to feel everything out and palpate the uterus (she pressed down on the area just below the stomach), then grabbed the speculum. Now, I have to say this. I'm a virgin, complete and utter virgin. So when she used the speculum I couldn't help but say \"WOAH,\" because I didn't even know you could have sensations in your cervix.\n",
      "\n",
      "((I forgot to add that I was being reminded to relax my legs and take easy breaths. Easy enough, I just kept forgetting because of all the feelings.))\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it was more of a pressure than anything but pressure is also a sensation. She swabbed the cervix with iodine (I think) and then started to measure my uterus. Before she did every step of the procedure she told me what was going to happen, and the second clinician gave more insight and both of them answered my questions during the whole thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measuring hurt, both in pressure and in real pain sensations. That's also where the full body heat waves and nausea kicked in. \n",
      "\n",
      "That was the worst part, and the quickest once I remembered to cough and relax. After that the IUD was prepped to be inserted. Inserted. Done. I was shaking all over, especially in the legs, and the waves of heat and nausea didn't help. They said once I relaxed that it was MUCH easier to see everything and that for a first-time insertion as a virgin I did better than expected. I was informed not to use any tampons for two months until the IUD (and strings) settle. They handed me some strings to feel and said those are what the ones on the IUD would feel. They felt like soft fishing line!\n",
      "\n",
      "After everything was wrapped up, they left and I got dressed and the clinician who did the procedure handed me a pamphlet and a paper packet with the information I needed, as well as a card that had my removal date on it. They're also doing my Nexplanon removal next week too, which I think is awesome! :D\n",
      "\n",
      "Going home was the worst part. Awful, crampy, strong nausea and I still had heat all over. I powered through it but it sucked so much. Scale of 1-10 I'd give that shit a 9 and I broke a toe once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, 3.5 hours later the cramping is still there but not as strong and the nausea and heat are gone. Bleeding is whatever since I already bled on Nexplanon, I'm still laying down because that experience wore me out. I never want a child, ever.\n",

She asked what birth control I was on, which was Junel Fe 24, and I was under the impression she would prescribe the same one, but she did not. I initially thought it was a generic, which would be fine, but from what I could tell from my research, the one she prescribed, Hailey 24 Fe is a completely different pill. I never had any issues on Junel, and am now suffering from acne breakouts without the help of the pill, but almost every review I have read about Hailey 24 Fe is that is caused weight gain and severe cystic acne. \n",

I had briefly considered the possibility of having it put in the same day, but figured I would have to schedule a separate appointment. I was, luckily, on the 4th day of my period so it was very light, nearly nonexistent, but I had my menstrual cup in when I went to the ___OFFICE___. I wait around a bit and the doc finally comes to see me and I start telling him my thoughts about either the Mirena or the ParaGard. He honestly wasn't very helpful, he didn't ask me what my periods are usually like, what my concerns with bc are, etc. But I told him what I thought he needed to know. Other than that I just kind of decided on the copper iud because if there is a chance a hormone free bc works for me then i get to keep it in and forget it for 10 years! So why not at least try. Anyway, the doctor said he could do it right now and I was so scared, I didn't even take ibuprofen before the appointment because I didn't think it would happen today! I called my mom and she encouraged me to just do it. So I put on my big girl pants and decided to take charge of my reproductive rights. \n",

I have never had a pap smear or anything, so the entire experience was completely foreign to me. The speculum was not as uncomfortable as I thought it was gonna be, that was fine. The pap smear I barely even felt anything. I didn't even realized he had clamped my cervix, so that was nothing to me. Then he used three big cotton swabs to clean my cervix i think. It felt uncomfortable in the way I can only imagine like a cotton swab on my eye. It was dry but I wasn't in pain at all. He talked me through the whole thing. He told me he was now going to measure my uterus and that I would feel and pinch and pressure. Well, I was getting ready to feel the worst pain in my life from the things I've read, but he put it in and yeah there was some pressure and it felt WEIRD but I was surprised that I didn't really feel any pain, just discomfort (does that make sense?). It also lasted all of like 3 seconds. Then it was time to get the IUD placed. Again, I was prepared for the worst. He puts the straw thing with the IUD in, it feels basically the same as the measuring but it lasts longer as he's making sure it's in position. Again, discomfort and a little pain but seriously nothing you can't handle. I would say 5/10 for me (But I know all bodies are different, I am fortunate that it wasn't extremely painful like what I have read). The worst part was when he had to stop some bleeding that the clamp caused on my cervix and he didnt have the chemical for it so he literally left me hanging for a good 10 seconds and i was just wanting to be done with it already. \n",

I was just very conscious of the fact that I now have a foreign object in my uterus and I don't know what it's gonna do. But I had minimal cramping, almost nothing. I was more mentally anxious. Anyway, I go to the parking lot where my mom is waiting for me and lmaooo just my luck the car wouldn't start and we called AAA. That's besides the point. I got home and still didn;t really have cramps, I was afraid to pee or poo because i just was worried about pushing it out (dont worry, you wont!!!). I did get freaked when I saw how much i was bleeding, I was expecting just light spotting but it was more reminiscent of a medium flow day. Since I wasn't in any pain, I just let it do it's thing. I relaxed the rest of the day and called my SO and we watched some shows together. I took an ibuprofen before going to bed because I was scared of getting cramps in my sleep, but I admit I was very lucky and hardly cramped at all as it is.

He actually scratched my arm with it over and over to make sure I couldn't feel it. It was so odd because I could HEAR the needle scraping the skin but couldn't feel a thing!\n",
      "\n",
      "First step then was to insert a needle underneath the implant, i think to keep it steady. I watched the procedure from this point which was really cool. He had this short needle pushed through my skin going underneath the implant (so in one side and out the other). He then used a scalpel or whatever to make an incision. It took longer than expected, although not very long. He was working away with some other tools trying to free the implant. He mentioned before starting that what happens is that fibrous tissue grows or builds up around the implant, so removing it takes some work to free it of this. He was working away and honestly I couldn't feel a thing. No pain, no discomfort. Perhaps occasionally some pressure or mild sensation of something happening but practically nothing.\n",

I scheduled my appointment to be during the start of my appointment, did all of my research to prepare, and took 600mg Ibuprofen beforehand. I was feeling extremely anxious about the pain some people experience. I even brought a stress ball to squeeze during it and told the doctor I was very nervous before we began. She walked me through everything and explained what she was doing and instructed me when to take deep breaths. To my surprise, I had very little pain! Just a few minor cramps while she was measuring my uterus. This is where things got disappointing. As she's measuring my uterus she goes \"hmm that can't be right\" and I'm like um what?? She then tells me that my uterus is only measuring about 4cm when the average is 6cm. She continues trying to measure it and get a longer number so she feels comfortable inserting the device. After about 20 minutes, she calls another doctor in to try. So there I am, laying spread eagle on a table with all my bits out, and this other doctor walks in and introduces herself. She attempts to measure and gets a higher number but says that my uterus feels like it's tilted. Great. Just great. The speculum is removed and she performs a manual digit exam and sure enough, yup, my uterus is angled to the right. And OF COURSE my ___OFFICE___ doesn't use ultrasound, and OF COURSE I'm only the second failed insertion so both of them aren't really sure what to do. The first doctor says she's gonna try for a few more minutes and then call it. So she starts poking around again and finally just says that she doesn't feel comfortable inserting it and possibly rupturing my uterus. I definitely appreciate that. But now I have to make another appointment with a womens clinic to get it inserted with ultrasound and maybe have to wait another month.

      "\n",
      "Once I was in my doctor’s ___OFFICE___, she explained everything that would happen and that she’d let me know every step of the way and I started to feel confident that I’d make it out okay. Onto the actual procedure now, Im 20 and have never had kids so she explained that she might have to measure my uterus twice in order to get an accurate reading of how long it was since my walls might be too tight. So she began by opening my cervix and I felt good! I felt it open and it wasn’t unpleasant so I was feeling hopeful for a breezy quick insertion! Once she put the sound in I felt a lot of cramping. and begun to worry! I normally don’t cramp during periods so that also might’ve been why the cramping felt uncomfortable for me but it wasn’t all too bad. Well, she was right about measurements and she only got 4” the first time around. she told me she’d try it again and I tried controlling my breathing because I was starting to rethink my decision but knew the pain was temporary. The second time around I started tensing up and the cramps hit me harder. She informed me that she was nervous about doing the measurements a 3rd time but that I was extremely calm and asked if it was okay and of course I agreed. with further help from the assistant in the room, she was able to finally get the length to a 6 1/2”! As soon as she said “we got it!” i felt a HUUUGE wave of relief. I knew it was almost over and couldn’t wait to get out of there. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know people mentioned before that their worst pain came from the IUD insertion and its opening up but for me it was the complete opposite! of course I felt it open up but as soon as it opened, it was only a few seconds before the cramp-y feeling left and the doctor began cleaning everything up. I was sweaty, hot, but I felt good. The cramping was subsiding and I felt proud of what I endured. I stayed laying down for a couple minutes and sat up feeling shaky in my hands but not dizzy or nauseous at all. I even walked across the street to where my car was! Overall, the pain is not insane, its definitely heavily dependent on where your heads at before and during the procedure. I spotted very lightly that afternoon and today I feel perfectly normal! No cramping, spotting, or any side effects and it makes me feel hopeful for this upcoming time in which my body accepts my Mirena :) \n",

      "\n",
      "I am 27 and have never had children. As far as birth control I have used the nuvaring on and off for the past 6 years, but that is all. \n",
      "\n",
      "The day before insertion I worked. I am a nightshift worker, so I got home the morning of the day of my appointment. I made sure to eat some breakfast when I first got home, and drank plenty of water during my shift. I slept for about three hours before waking up and getting ready to head to my appointment (this was actually my biggest concern, because who feels great with lack of sleep, and nightshift already makes you feel cruddy enough). unfortunately, I didnt have ibuprofen, so I took a Midol. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a side note, I was not on my period for insertion. I was two weeks post period during my appointment. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been seeing my NP since I was 18, so I'm very comfortable with her. My significant other came along with me so I could hold his hand during the procedure and just in case I couldn't drive myself afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only other medication used during my insertion was a lidocaine type spray (I can't recall the name, but I know it started with a B). My NP explained it was to numb the entrance of the cervix, but unfortunately that is all it would do. She said other patients describe a burning type sensation with this, but I didnt notice this at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an anxious individual, so at this point I'm really feeling panicky. I have scheduled my IUD appointment 5 TIMES in the last 6 years and canceled each one. I'm the worst. I also would say I'm not the best with pain. I probably have a medium pain tolerance, but I think my anxiety gets the best of me in most situations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The insertion was what I would consider a more painful period cramp. I am someone who gets pretty painful cramping during my period, so it honestly wasnt a feeling I hadn't experienced before. I would rate the whole procedure a 4/10. I had no N/V afterwards and never felt faint. I felt the worst part for me was the clamp. I could see the insertion being painful if you are someone who does not experience moderate to severe menstrual cramping. I think the big thing that helped me was my yoga breathing. Sounds cliche, but it worked!\n",
      "\n",
      "My SO met me at the ___OFFICE___ when he got off work, so each of us had our vehicles there. I felt so great I ended up driving myself rather than one of us leaving our trucks. I would say the cramping afterwards was worse than the procedure itself, but nothing worse than what I have experienced during a particularly brutal menstruation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since insertion (we are at the 10 hour mark) I have had some light bleeding, and have been rotating with tylenol, ibuprofen, and Midol every 6 hours). If you decide to do the same, just be sure of your tylenol intake, because there is tylenol in Midol too.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was aware that the procedure itself was painful, but I believed that I would have a similar experience to my bff since she was also a virgin until recently.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, I had it done in late November of 2019. The insertion itself was yes, very painful, but brief. After it was in, my doctor complimented my handling of the pain and left the room to let me get dressed. And then the real pain hit. I had experienced painful period cramps in the past, on levels of 8/10. This pain however, was immense and debilitating. The cramping spread to my back and upper thighs, the pressure and burning had me keeled over and crying out in agony. I would give it 10/10 pain, but only if it had caused me to faint or vomit, so I give it a 9.5 instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor returned and offered to give me pain medince, but since I had ibuprofen earlier before the procedure I would have to continue using that same one (since you can't mix pain meds).  After about 15 minutes of searing pain, my cramps minimized and I was able to leave the ___OFFICE___. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in mild pain at home for a few hours, but the excruciating pain returned and I was once again laid up on the couch, taking the maximum amount of pain meds and hoping sleep could give me some relief. The following 36 hours consisted of me withering on and off, counting down the hours and minutes till I could take another maximum dose of advil. Some hours would be mild, others I was moaning and clenched on the floor. It was miserable and if the pain hadn't seized by the middle of the following day I would return to the doctor. Alas,  the pain eventually subsided and I was able to have sex without discomfort about 5 days later. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, time skip to now. My periods are lighter but longer, lasting a week instead of 4 days. I spot for two weeks and then I'm clear for two weeks. I have mild cramping, but about once every other month I get debilitating cramps that put me down. I also have emotional breakdowns several times a month now, but I wasn't in the best headspace prior to my insertion, so I'm not sure if it's a side effect. \n",

      "So now coming to my 4th month of having the Mirena, I still don't know if I made the right decision and if I would have it replaced come November of 2024. The longer span of spoting and random bouts of extremely painful cramps are already bad enough. But the pain of insertion itself...it was just too much. I fear the pain so much that when I went to get my strings checked I was holding my breath. The relief I felt when everything was fine was revealing. My doctor informed me that I could get it removed in time if the complications continued. But knowing that removal is just as painful is one of the main reasons why I'm just keeping it in and accepting this as my life now. Every BC has side effects, and honestly I would take these pains over weight gain and loss of sex drive. \n",

It was strange for my to get my period twice a year. Now, suddenly, from November-March I’ve had my period three times. Which doesn’t seem like a lot but is completely inconsistent with how my body has been the past four years. I’ve already had it in five months more than I usually do in an entire year. I’m due to get this implant out in February 2021, so I’m wondering if somethings gone wrong with it and it needs to be removed sooner possibly? Has anyone else had anything like this happen?

      "**Pre Insertion:** I woke up around 9:00 and had started my period! yay! it was the one and only time I would celebrate bleeding, the Dr. said it would help open my cervix and make it better for insertion. I had an appt. at 11:15 I decided after reading other posts id take a Naproxen (Like IBprofen, from a previous muscule strain) at 10:00 before I went in, I'm sure 2 IBprofin would work the same. I \n",
      "\n",
      "**Insertion:** I went in with the thought process of \"just relax\". after answering any questions I had he opened me up with the clamps and informed me I might feel a pinch or cramp-like feeling. AND OH THE CRAMPS!!... BUT. It only lasted a few seconds as he was measuring the depth. it was ok at first and then felt like a bad cramp, but nothing I haven't felt before. He pulled out and asked about how I was doing and I got the chance to ask if the insertion would be that bad. he said yes. he gave me a heads up before the insertion and I felt a little cramp and a lot of uncomfortable. but I waited for the same pain I felt before. and waited. and waited.... and he said it's all done. the pain never came. he then went to cut the strings and I got a little cramping from that. after I got to sit up my pain went away altogether. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Post insertion:** The cramps were off and on for 3 hours after but I was able to go to Costco (to get pads, I wasn't prepared), dairy queen (lunch), and the liquor store (wine) before heading home. I took a short 2-hour nap and woke up with no pain. I am currently writing this in PJs having my 5th glass of wine and no pian. I haven't taken pain relievers since before the DR appt. \n",

      "**So overall...** STOP reading over the internet, and freaking yourself out. it's different for everyone, but there are positive experiences that come from the insertion. You won't ever know how it is for you until the Dr. pokes you. But I can say if you go in relaxed and trusting you Dr. you will have a way better experience then if you stress and worry over something you can't change. I'm not saying don't research paragard. do all the research you can on the Bc to decide if you want it. but don't make your decision based on insertion reviews. that is only a few minutes in 10 years.

      "After I(25) had my child in 2014 I got the 5-year Mirena IUD. It was great! Other than the cramps for the few hours after insertion, I had no bleeding, no pain, no problems for 5 years. Last year I had it replaced and once again everything went great. Earlier this March (8 months after insertion) a day after sexual intercourse I began to have cramps and bleeding. I had never experienced these types of side effects with my iud so I went to my OBGYN who confirmed my belief that it had moved. She removed my iud and had me wait 10 days to make sure I was not pregnant before replacing it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, yesterday I went in to have a new IUD inserted. Because of the COVID-19, the OBGYN ___OFFICE___ is trying to attend all the patients they can and I felt that’s why my appointment felt a bit rushed.  During the insertion (sorry if it’s tmi) she said that one of my tubes(?) was sloping or slanted (honestly, don’t remember the wording she used) so she had to use a dilator. But she didn’t seem worried about it or say anything else about it. Afterwards she told me that usually after someone’s IUD moves, when it is reinserted they usually have no problems with it again and since I had a perfect term with it before, she was confident I’d be okay. \n",
      "When I got home I was cramping throughout the day, which was longer than usual, and I was also bleeding which had never happened to me after an insertion. Additionally, I was feeling a small pain along my right side of my abdomen. \n",

After years on the pill, I felt like it was starting to wreak havoc with my moods, energy level and even sex drive. So I was drawn to the prospect of having a much lower dose of hormones, localised to the uterus. Plus, I would accidentally occasionally miss pills and it was just getting annoying taking them every day and having to go back to the doctor just for a script every time they ran out. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the consultation and received the script for the IUD. My doctor is very experienced with IUD insertions and was extremely supportive of me going through with it. I think this made a HUGE difference. She asked me to wait and schedule the appointment for a week when I am on my period. She told me it is actually better to have it done during your period because the uterus is in a better position or something, plus then they are sure you're not pregnant already. \n",

      "Day of insertion - my appointment was scheduled for lunchtime. I arrived and had another quick consult with my doctor to ensure everything was ok to go ahead. She then took me into the surgery room to get it done. I stripped down and laid down on the bed with a sheet over me. She gave me a pillow to put under my butt and lower back to elevate my pelvis a bit to make it easier. I was nervous at this point but ok, and just taking deep breaths while chatting away with her. She made a point of talking me through the whole process and not rushing anything.\n",

      "1. Swabbed and cleaned cervix with some sort of solution. This didn't hurt, just felt cold. \n",
      "2. Used a small amount of local anaesthetic to my cervix. This felt like a small sharp pinprick. Not too bad. \n",
      "3. Measured my uterus using a long thin instrument. This was a bit uncomfortable and felt like a cramp or pressure in my lower abdomen, like a moderately painful period cramp but only lasted maybe 10 seconds. \n",
      "4. Inserted the IUD. Again, this part was a bit uncomfortable and felt like cramping. But it also only lasted a very short time. Very manageable. \n",
      "5. Cut the strings - I didn't feel anything when she did this. \n",
      "6. Everything is done and the speculum gets taken out. It's all over! \n",

      "The 3-4 days following the insertion I had mild cramping that was easily managed with heat packs and ibuprofen. I went home and relaxed on the lounge with Netflix for the rest of that day but it didn't stop me from being able to go out and do things, and I was back to work as normal on the Monday (insertion was Friday afternoon). The day of the insertion, I went out for dinner and drinks that night and was fine.\n",

      "So I had the second shot. And the bleeding continued. By this point the side effects were hitting me full force. I had gone from a size 6 to a size 20 despite not changing my healthy diet or my exercise, my hair started falling out in clumps, I was a complete horror to be around, felt depressed all the time and eventually confined myself to my house due to the weight gain. I ended up being diagnosed with anxiety and depression. \n",

I went on to do my own research and found it is the most dangerous contraception to exist, its even banned in some countries and has a black box warning. \n",
      "One of the side effects was women struggling to conceive after wards. And this terrified me. \n",
      "Anyways, 4 months after my last shot, the bleeding stopped. You'd think that would be a good thing, right? Wrong. I ended up waiting 4 YEARS for my periods to come back. For 4 years, every single month, I felt like I was on my period without actually bleeding. My doctors kept giving me different pills to bring the bleeding back and none worked. Then 4 years on, I get my first period. It lasted 6 weeks and was so painful and heavy I couldn't leave the house. I would rather give birth hundred times than have that period again. Eventually my periods came back regular, and things started getting back to normal. \n",
      "We'd been told we could try and conceive before my periods came back so as soon as the bleeding stopped back after I stopped the depo, we started trying. \n",
      "It's now 2020. And I still have one child. The last few years have been incredibly hard. In 2018 I had a chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage. In 2019 I had 2 miscarriages.

      "Ever since I found out that this is a thing I’ve been paranoid about it. I got my kyleena inserted about 3 weeks ago. Everything has been okay since. The insertion was hard and i sported for about a week or so after. According to my period tracking app I’m supposed to get my period in three days. Yesterday i woke up very early and peed and it sort of hurt to pee. Later in the day I got the worse stabbing pain in my right side. It kept coming and going until it went away at night. I slept with no problems and woke up the next day and was fine. About an hour ago the pains are back but sharper and now it’s on my right side too. Very painful it feels like the insertion pain over and over and it comes in waves. I also have some brown discharge. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m getting my period or if my kyleena is expelling! I’m not comfortable checking my strings and WASNT really taught how. My boyfriend said he doesn’t feel then when we have sex. Idk if this matters but I’m 23 and this is the first birth control I’ve ever been on. My checkup is in three weeks but I want to go in ASAP. I’m at work right now and won’t be able to make it in to the ___OFFICE___ and it’s Friday so I won’t be able to until Monday and I just wanna know that I’m not gonna die of something.\n",

      "TL;DR: my insurance company won’t release my birth control to me for another day, meaning I’ll be 2 days behind on pills, so would I just take those two pills as soon as I picked up the prescription and then take my pill again at it’s normal time or do I start new birth control all over again? \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay so: \n",
      "I usually don’t take the last row of pills in the pack; because I just start a new pack of birth control pills, so I can skip my period because they’re too intense for me. I noticed I was coming up to placebo week so I called my pharmacy to refill my prescription ahead of time. They told me it would be ready after 1pm. I go to the pharmacy when I get off work and they told me I can’t pick it up until Saturday because that’s when my insurance company will not pay for me to pick it up early. \n",

      "I asked the pharmacist who I would need to speak to in order to pick up my birth control early, and she told me I would need to call my insurance company &amp; I did. \n",
      "They then told me that they couldn’t override my script order because the way my doctor wrote my prescription was a ‘dispense as ordered’. I then call my gyno’s ___OFFICE___ to see if we can get the entire thing cleared up to then find out from the receptionist who was extremely rude that my doctor had left the practice and the last time I had seen her, was her last week there. She told me the only way I could get it taken care of was coming into the ___OFFICE___ that day for a doctor to see me. I told her I literally could not make it to the ___OFFICE___ before 5:45 - I live in NYC &amp; work in the city, getting to the doctor would have taken me at LEAST an hour with the trains. \n",
      "\n",
      "The receptionist then told me “you should never double up on pills, take one a day until your back to normal” which literally makes no sense because I’m going to be ALL the way off since my birth control wasn’t given to me early enough so I can continue to take it on time. She then told me that she asked a Physician’s Assistant to explain that I could double up until I caught up which would be pointless because she just said I shouldn’t double up? Literally could not even get a doctor on the phone for the life of me. So now I won’t be able to pickup my prescription until tomorrow, which would make me 2 days behind pills \n",

I felt nothing - I wouldn’t even have been aware she had put the implant in had I not heard the click of the plunger! She put steristrips on, a large bandaid, and wrapped my arm in gauze. \n",

      "I got my first Mirena just over 5 years ago. From what I could recall the measurement part was the worst. It felt like I got stabbed in the uterus. I took 600mg ibuprofen beforehand, but remember that it was overall quite unpleasant. That being said, I didn't pass out and I was able to drive myself home. My five years was up last December and I had to take it out. I am not in a LTR and was sexually active for less than half of the time I had the IUD, but despite this I loved having it in. Hormonal fluctuations with my period caused me depression on the days leading up to my period and significant cramping for the first 2 days of my period. Mirena caused my periods to stop completely and all of that went away. I loved never having to think about my periods. I did not experience any significant side effects. Taking the Mirena out felt like losing a part of me (dramatic, I know), but I also knew I wanted it back in as soon as possible. However, I was still very anxious about the insertion...\n",

      "My appointment was this afternoon. I worked in the morning and took the rest of the day off. I took 800mg of ibuprofen ahead  of time and a valium I had leftover to calm down (not usual protocol haha). It was the last day of my period and I wasn't really bleeding anymore, but my ob/gyn ___OFFICE___ couldn't move up the appointment to monday or tuesday.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My OB/GYN was amazing. He walked me through the whole process, which took around 2-3 minutes. The first \"pinch\" of the tenaculum was mildly uncomfortable. The measuring of the uterus was a big pinchy cramp that lasted like 15 seconds and then I had a 30 second rest before the IUD was inserted which was another pinchy cramp that was quite uncomfortable, but I just did some deep breathing (like a Lamaze class my OB told me later), clenched my fists, and it was fine. And just like that it was all over. I walked home from the procedure (basically across the street) and had some mild cramping. I just woke up from a nap and I feel back to normal. No cramping, no bleeding. I am so so happy now to have my IUD back and so glad my fears of insertion did not prevent me from getting it re-inserted. 10/10 highly recommend!!!\n",

My fiance and my family have all been really great with supporting me emotionally (fiance and my mom are planning on coming with me to get it removed so I dont completely freak out) but i really cannot shake this feeling.

      "  \n",
      "As for my birth control background I had been on the combination pill for about 6 years, the first 5 on a brand I don't remember, the last 1 on Tri Lo Sprintec.  I started on it to manage violent period cramps that sent me to the hospital monthly, seriously they were so bad I thought my appendicitis was mild cramping from an early period.  The first 5 years I was totally fine, I noticed a very slight and slow drop in libido but other than that I was fine.  The last year while on Tri Lo Sprintec was miserable, I spotted pretty much the entire year with inconsistent periods, absolutely no libido, intense depression, irritability, and anxiety.  I didn't even want to joke with my boyfriend about sex let alone actually touch him, I'm 23 and had a raging sex drive before I should WANT to touch him.  I told my gyno and we decided an IUD would suit me even though I had vaginismus and was terrified of the insertion process. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got my period and they scheduled the insertion for day 4 of my period.  They had me put 4 misoprostol pills into my vagina 14 hours before insertion, these stupid things are hexagon shaped which is the most inconvenient shape to try to put up there, so many sharp corners.  (Three ended up expelling about 4 hours later into the toilet, love that for me.)  Day of insertion I was nervous, I made sure to eat and take 800mg of ibuprofen.  My Dr. put in the speculum and that sucked but no more than usual.  She then measured my uterus, this feels like a deep cramp and you're pretty aware that something is in your uterus because you can kind of feel the device poke the back of your uterus but I promise that isn't as scary as it sounds.  I ended up needing a dilator for my cervix because the inserter for the IUD wouldn't fit, this felt like another cramp but more like an intense regular period cramp vs the deep almost sharp cramp you feel with the sounding device.  The actual insertion felt like a very intense cramp that lasted about 20 entire seconds while she was letting the IUD arms release, at this point you can't even really feel the speculum in comparison.  By the time she was trimming the strings the most uncomfortable thing was the speculum still being there because my uterus was cramping around the IUD and I just wanted to close my legs and roll to the side.  I was pretty light headed after and the cramps following the IUD placement were about the same intensity as an intense angry period.  My doctor was done in a total of maybe 2-3 minutes with the entire process.  It took me about 30 minutes to be able to sit up and another 15 before I was comfortable standing up and walking out of the ___OFFICE___.    \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm now 4 days post IUD insertion.  For the day I got it inserted, I lived off ibuprofen and my heating pad, I felt every bump in the road on the drive home, some positions were uncomfortable like bending over sucked, I was sore and crampy all day.  For the second day I was still sore and crampy but I felt more like a period than it did on the first day, it's hard to explain but for me I was just too aware that I had plastic put into me for the first day to feel like I was just having period cramps.  For the 3rd and 4th day I only need my heating pad after too much physical activity and haven't really needed ibuprofen past the second day.  Also once I got it inserted my period just full stopped and I haven't had any spotting or anything as of yet.  My sex drive has already seen massive improvement even through the post insertion cramping so I'm hopeful for the future of my sex life again! \n",
      "\n",
      "Insertion sucks and it does hurt but it's not the worst thing I've ever felt nor is it unbearable, it's mostly uncomfortable.  An IUD is totally worth it, being able to delete the “pill” alarm off my phone and just never worry about it again is so freeing!  I highly recommend even though the process seems scary it's short lived and definitely worth it!\n",

I’ve been a very happy hormonal IUD user, having had the Mirena twice and now the Liletta since PP has switched their offering.

      "-I have increased exercise over the past month, or at least switched types of exercise with more strength raining at a new gym\n",
      "-The pain isn’t during sex or exercise but sometimes after one or the other, mostly random timing\n",
      "-This doctor was great when I went in for serology and TB testing / vaccine updates for work and school, but I have no idea how she or her ___OFFICE___ feel about birth control and women’s health issues. \n",
      "-I was referred for an ultra-sound in the US when I had my first Mirena and my PP GYN couldn’t locate the strings.  I had no pain then and no symptoms or issues apart from disappearing strings at the time, but the ultra-sound was good for piece of mind as well as being done really quickly and non-invasively. \n",
      "-I do have medicare in Australia, no additional private insurance. \n",

      "-Without hormonal BC I have very heavy, painful periods that last 10+ days, and HBC pills or the hormonal IUD make life much easier\n",

If I need to have the Liletta removed, then I’ll most likely opt to get another Mirena, and I’ll have to pay out of pocket for most of the cost. I would strongly prefer not to go through a removal and reinsertion after less than 6 months with the Liletta, but that would be better than the other worst case scenarios I’m imagining at the moment. Going on the pill for bit would be another option, but not my first choice. \n",

So at the beginning of this year I decided to get back on the birth control shot. Almost immediately after my first injection I started spotting lightly, which i expected because I remembered spotting a bit when I first started taking it in high school. Except, it hasn’t stopped and it’s only gotten heavier. A little over a month now i’ve been bleeding nonstop. I don’t remember my cycle becoming this screwed up when I started taking it and I worry I’m going to have to yet again find another BC, but at this point I just don’t care anymore.

      "Back story: I’m 24 year years old and I’ve been on the same birth control (Vienva) for the past 2 years. I have only ever missed it once in a while. In February, I missed about 9 days of my OCP because I had forgotten to take it (I had a lot of family stuff going on at that time) and I completely missed my period. I took about 2-3 at home tests that were negative. Then I went to my OBGYN and they also did a urine test in ___OFFICE___ which was negative and all she said to me was that it’s normal to miss a period on birth control. This made no sense to me since I’ve been on the same birth control for 2 years and NEVER missed a period before. During March my period was a couple of days late but much lighter than it usually ever is.  \n",

During this month when I went to pick up my birth control from my pharmacy, they didn’t have my typical Vienva that I’ve been on but instead I got Lessina which has the same generic ingredients, which is, levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. My pharmacy was late on getting my rx from my doctor so I continued the Vienva pills for my first week of the hormone pill and the second week is when I started the Lessina. I missed two days of pills on my second week but not consecutively. As I’ve been expecting my period, I have been getting cramps intermittently over the past few days like I would be getting my period but I still haven’t had any bleeding at all. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’ve had my paragard for 2 years exactly. My period came on time last month, everything was great...until the period didn’t go away. It just kept going, and going. And going. On the 12th day I decided to call an advice nurse through my university, because normally my periods are like clockwork and almost two weeks of bleeding ain’t normal. Even though they said I was probably fine, I took a pregnancy test that night, and lo and behold—not one, but two strong positives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short, they had me go in the next day. Then they sent me to the local ER because they didn’t have ultrasound equipment at the student health ___OFFICE___. I had a clairvoyant dildo shoved in me because they couldn’t see anything on the regular ultrasound. Had some bloodwork done. Aside from the fact that they wouldn’t let my boyfriend be with me due to the COVID measures, I learned that my local hospital is actually amazing as far as hospitals go. The shear kindness of the blood draw tech who taught me how to find my own deep-buried veins, which most techs have to use 2-3 needles to find, will stick with me forever. \n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out I was only at 4 weeks, and the ultrasound was inconclusive except in determining the fetus was too small to see (and also too small to burst a tube). They sent me to an ob/gyn later that week, who felt it was likely ectopic. We agreed on methotrexate injections—I was told it was essentially low-dose chemo and that they’d monitor my hCG levels through bloodwork until I reached 0 hCG. They also let me keep my paragard, since it was perfectly positioned and I will need birth control for the next three months anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for how I feel about it, I hope my attempts to keep this light weren’t misplaced or taken the wrong way. My partner and I have felt pretty down about the whole thing. Even though we weren’t in a position to keep it if it had been viable, it’s still sad. It’s not a situation we wanted. We want to have kids together someday, which almost makes it worse I think. I’m not overcome with guilt only because I know I did everything I could to prevent this situation in the first place, and that it really wasn’t a choice to keep it or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was told by the two doctors I saw that this happens to 3/1000 women annually, presumably in the US and with paragard specifically though I do not have confirmation on that. I still think paragard is right for me for several reasons I won’t go into. Even the very best isn’t always perfect, this is the extremely small risk you take on when you sign up for birth control. I see no reason to switch to a slightly less effective method just because this one failed once. I was super unlucky in having this happen, but I was also super lucky in being in a place where the wonders of modern medicine could take care of me. This probably won’t happen again from my understanding. \n",

But also yesterday, I transitioned from “light bleeding” to “spotting.” My boyfriend hates blood, but finally gave in to some slow, quality fun. I go in tomorrow for another blood draw, and if all goes well I’ll have another later this week and if I hit 0 hCG this incident will be over.

Never again, it felt like it was ripping me open from the inside - I have a very sensitive uterus and everything else - and when she checked it with the ultrasound it wasn’t in properly, so she had to take it out again. I have to say, she was amazing at making me feel comfortable, it was just too painful.

      "I had my Jaydess IUD replaced with the Kyleena IUD recently as the Jaydess was expiring this month so I thought I’d document how the procedure itself went and how the past two weeks of adjustment have been for anyone who is interested. I chose the Kyleena because it is the same size as the Jaydess, but smaller than Mirena and lasts the same time as Mirena (5 years) but with a lower dose of hormones. \n",

      "I had gone to a new clinic for my IUD replacement as the other one I went to for my Jaydess was closed for COVID. I was also due to get my period any day then. When I arrived, I spoke to a nurse to confirm I wasn’t pregnant as I was not on my period during that time but I didn’t feel I needed to take a pregnancy test because the last time I had sex was in January and I’ve had periods since then. After that, the doctor wrote me a prescription for the Kyleena IUD which I had to pick up at the pharmacy downstairs. Fortunately, being a Canadian and under 25 years old, the IUD was free but the clinic had a $40 IUD removal fee. \n",
      "\n",
      "I returned to the ___OFFICE___, and waited to be brought into the medical suite. Once I was brought in, I stripped from the waist down and met with the doctor while I got into the bed with the stirrups. The doctor first gave me xylocaine (a local anesthetic) injection in my uterus which my last clinic didn’t, and the local really helped. The needle in my cervix wasn’t great, it was a small sharp poke. Then, with a nurse using ultrasound externally, the doctor had to fish out my old IUD because she couldn’t find the strings. She used a hook-like instrument which I didn’t feel at all be inserted into my cervix but it was a crampy sensation in my uterus when she was removing it. After that, she inserted my new IUD which I didn’t feel going into my cervix but it did feel very uncomfortable in my uterus, but it wasn’t unbearable. The nurse was also pressing on my stomach with the ultrasound probe and that helped with the pain. I did bleed quite a bit which I didn’t notice until I stood up. All in all, it took 12 minutes from when I got into the suite to cleaning up and leaving. I was able to drive myself home and did not experience any cramping until about 9 hours later and those cramps felt like regular cramps I get on my period and were manageable. I had also taken an Advil 1.5 hours before the procedure and then directly after. \n",

      "So far it is going well and the procedure itself I would describe as overall a weird feeling, uncomfortable and sharp pain at some parts but not so painful that I was out for the rest of the day. When I had my Jaydess inserted 3 years ago they didn’t use a local anesthetic and that was a little more painful but was so quick that I was not greatly affected and was able to walk home from the clinic.

I was having trouble sleeping, I was sleepwalking and had some very normal teenage anxiety. My doctor decided I was hormonal and depressed and birth control would fix my anxiety and sleepwalking (side point, if I was a teenage boy coming to the doctor for anxiety and sleepwalking, would they still prescribe me birth control? Yeah, no!). So I switched around 3 different types of pills, struggling with different levels of moodiness with each before getting Nexplanon.\n",

It did not last even a full year before I noticed some discomfort and irregular bleeding. It had moved positions (it dropped down to my lower uterus) and I had to get it removed in January. I got Mirena in the same visit, and this week I'm experiencing the same discomfort and irregular bleeding. Last night I briefly woke up to roll over in bed and felt some pretty intense stabbing.

So to calm my mind i took a pregnamcy test.\n",

It expired the beginning of March, this is my second time on the implant... last time I had removed after a year of use.

Like with it still in their arm? How possible is it? I have sex.... everyday... that being said also my period comes every 4-7 weeks so it’s very hard to track.\n",

      "After I gave birth to my daughter, my husband and I decided for me to get the implant (Implanon NXT) as I couldn't be bothered to take pills anymore (was on Yaz/Yasmin before I gave birth) and the thought of IUDs scare me. Also going in every few months for a shot seemed so inconvenient.\n",

I know the chances of pregnancy with the implant is rare, but I do pregnancy tests just to be sure and keep my anxiety down.\n",

But now I'm getting such bad and painful breakouts which make me feel so completely ugly. I've changed my skincare routine around 3 times just trying to find something to soothe the redness and reduce the breakouts, but so far nothing has worked. I'm breaking out in places that I NEVER used to have breakouts before - like my forehead, cheeks and at my jawline. I feel like I look like a hormonal teenager (my breakouts weren't even this bad when I was a teen :( )\n",
      "2. Cranky/Grumpy/Mood swings - my mood shifts so fast, I can be happy and laughing one minute and the next I can be so angry and upset at the smallest thing. I can go from 0 to 100 in a nanosecond. My husband has been so great with my mood swings - he understands that its a side effect and has been so incredibly patient. But I still feel like such an asshole after my sudden outbursts. I've never been one to have anxiety issues, but I feel anxious over the smallest and dumbest things. \n",
      "3. Zero sex drive - I don't want to go into details about this but you know what I mean. It takes A LOT to get my motors running. And it doesn't help that I feel that I look so unattractive.\n",
      "4. Appetite - I think I've put on so much weight post pregnancy that I feel like I still look pregnant at times. The bloating and water retention doesn't help either.\n",

However the “attacks” only happened once every few months, I moved about a year ago and hadn’t found a new primary care doctor or OBGYN so I just dealt with them as they came. Then the start of 2020 I started getting the cramps way more often, once or twice a month, and the past month I usually will have them once a week or not more.

I’ve always had bad period cramps, but not like this.\n",

The first time my cervix was too small for the sounding tool to go through so the most recent two times I have taken misoprostol beforehand. The doctors told me that they run into serious “resistance” when they are doing the sounding and they don’t want to push any further.

      "Once she came back in, she had my get in stirrups. She placed the speculum and cleaned my cervix with an antiseptic-soaked cotton swab. She then sounded my cervix, which was a very quick, sharp cramp. Next came the IUD — again, another quick sharp cramp. I would say at its very worst... a 5/10 on the pain level. We were having a side conversation and the pain caught my breath a time or two. All together, insertion seriously lasted &lt;2 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "My doctor had my stay laying for a minute or two while she did the paperwork. I sat up and felt OK... I was left to get dressed and scheduled a follow-up appointment a month from now. No problem driving myself home. \n",

I know that post-insertion bleeding is common, so I wasn't too concerned, but because the bleeding has been getting heavier over the past few days, and I have passed a couple bigger clots, I got nervous.

Personally, it was just a teeny bit less painful for me. Literally, one moment I was relaxing from the pain/discomfort from the measuring, I asked if they were about to insert the IUD, braced myself when they said yes, and... Nothing really happened.

(A solid 11, from 1 to 10. I thought I was going to pass out and just die. I had to tell them to take a break in between the process too.) My cervix wasn't opening up and they had to dilate me multiple times. It took at least half an hour for the insertion and by the time I was leaving the ___OFFICE___ I was having such severe cramps that I almost didn't drive home and had someone picked me up instead.

(Pain level: Solid 8/9 with a dash of 10s once in a while she poked around) There was a few points in time where I did yell out in pain but it wasn't so that I need her to stop.

I had absolutely no side effects from it and went to bed with ease. An hour before insertion they had me take 600 mg of Advil.

But, I’m not going to lie, it wasn’t a completely painless experience. They first used a speculum and cleaned my cervix, both of which were painless. Then they used a tool to stabilize my cervix and there was a sharp pain that made me gasp, and then measured my uterus which was also a very strange sensation. They also had to dilate my cervix a bit more which made me feel a bit woozy, but then they inserted the paraguard and that was it! \n",

I layed in the ___OFFICE___ for more than an hour waiting until the pain was tolerable enough to get up. I had basically a nonstop 7/10 cramp. Made me wring my hands and feet, but eventually it calmed down. After an hour the pain went down to a 4.5/10 and I went home. Three hours after insertion the cramping completely went away; it was like there was nothing there. I didn’t take any more pain medication and just took a quick hot shower to ease any remaining cramping when I got home. Didn’t even need a hot water bottle. \n",

      "Fast forward about 3 months, all of a sudden I can feel my strings near the opening of my vagina. I’d had random painful cramping, which I didn’t think much about as that was normal for the first 3-6 months post insertion. I went in just in case, turns out my IUD had moved to the bottom of my uterus and was embedded. Ouch. And lucky me, it’s only the 2nd time my doctor has seen something like this in 20 years of practice. I also had a UTI that is probably unrelated. \n",

I tried bringing this concern up to my doctor after calling and practically begging for them to remove the Nexplanon.

When I walked into the room, I saw they set up the room to not only take out Nexplanon, but they also had an iud ready to be inserted after.... Not only was there an iud, but it was Liletta, which is hormonal. I told them right away I did not want the hormonal iud (they seemed annoyed by this), and I just wanted the Nexplanon removed. \n",

      "My doctor came in and asked what I would like instead, I told her the copper, but similar to every other time I have brought it up, they always tell me I should try a different form of hormonal because the copper \"isn't very popular\". She instead offered to re-insert a new Nexplanon after I explained that I didn't like the side effects and I wanted to learn more about the copper.

      "The bimanual exam, speculum insertion, and cleaning were all absolutely fine. What I found extremely painful was actually when the doctor used a tenaculum to straighten out my uterus and keep it in position.

At some point, though, I started crying and trembling from the pain and pretty much kept crying until it was all over 🙃\n",
      "\n",
      "The sounding was, of course, uncomfortable, but I was already in so much pain from the tenaculum that I almost didn't notice. My uterus was big enough for the IUD and that's all I really cared about, to be honest. Once that was done, it was fairly smooth for the doctor to insert the IUD applicator and put the device in place, then cut the strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to lie on the exam table for at least 15 minutes afterward to decompress and dry my tears. I was still in a good deal of pain, similar to really bad period cramps. Thankfully, I was okay enough to drive myself home after making sure I wouldn't faint when I moved.\n",

The pain is definitely still there, though, so I'm glad I took the day off work.\n",

Well, despite the pain, I got through it. 💪 And I know that I'll be protected from pregnancy for about 5 years.

And I’ve never gotten the shot before so I wasn’t sure of the more common side effects so I just figured it to be normal after an injection then my arm gets extremely painful inflamed on the inside my thumb and my index finger become very weak and tingly. I called the doctors ___OFFICE___ back and I told him my symptoms and they recommend me to take some ibuprofen and Benadryl so I took 60 mg of ibuprofen I took 25 mg of Benadryl and I waited when I got home I had red markings on the back of my arm not scratch marks those looked different I was trying not to scratch as to not irritate the area. But the pain becomes even worse as I wait I try taking more ibuprofen but it comes to the point where I cannot be comfortable in any position and I am nearly in tears so I call the doctor after hours and I explain my symptoms and she recommends me going to the ER the doctor in the ER looks at my arm and feels the area and says that I could be having an allergic reaction so he gives me medicine for that as well as Tracy give me morphine however because I am skinny and my body synthesizes things more quickly than others so they had to up me to tramadol... he comes in a couple hours later after giving me the pain medication, steroids, and allergy medication and says that I could possibly be at risk of some sort of auto immune disease because of how I reacted to the Depo-Provera shot as well as the injection could’ve caused some nerve pain and damage...so I went home i’ve been taking my medication as prescribed and on day four I still have a limp wrist tingling in the upper parts of the top of my arm and forearm the pain is managed with medication but what do I do help?\n",

She gave me this shpeal about how its 92-93% effective (pretty sure thats bullshit, unless shes talking about the full span of the 12 years its in?

Her awkward persona in the beginning didnt help me feel comfortable either. The nurse there held my hand (they wouldn’t let in anyone other than patients because of coronavirus so my boyfriend couldn’t hold my hand sadly) and listened to me while i cried about how i needed to get it because of the depression the pills gave me. The doctor kept telling me i could change my mind at any time (which honestly only made me more scared and i almost took the chance), but the nurse held my hand which gave me the strength to let them do it (thank you jennifer). \n",
      "The most discomfort honestly came from the specula (again i think thats what its called? The thing they use to open you for a pap). As soon as she pulled out the specula when she was done, i felt totally fine other than the cramps. \n",
      "Everything else — the cleaning, the measuring, the actual insertion — just felt like cramps. Very weird thinking of being open and having someone poking you feeling like a cramp and not a stab, but it literally just feels like terrible concentrated cramps. \n",

      "I DID take 800mg of ibuprofen 30 minutes before the appointment and it didn’t do much (i think 30 minutes isn’t early enough) so i accepted the shot in my hip for the pain which kicks in very fast. That nurse was very sweet also and touched my arm and said “this is me wanting to hug you.” Everyone there was understanding. \n",

      "I think this wasn’t such a good idea, not necessarily because the doctor said wait a week, but because i am very sore. Not cramping so much as like... sore muscles. My abs are sore too? I think this is from the constant cramps and just reacting to the pain. Also i have cried a lot. My cramping is also now more of a stabbing feeling than a regular dull twisting of cramps. I think this may be because i had sex so soon. Like my entire vagina and stuff is quite swollen and cramping and the dick just kinda stretched it a little? Also i did a lot of sitting in a hard chair supporting myself painting, i suggest taking it EASY EASY just in bed/couch.

Like i haven’t felt cramps at all in 4 years and they were never strong like these. I did break more rules and stuck my fingers up there and looked for the strings but i didn’t feel them, which is good because that means its inside! but worrisome because i think I’m supposed to feel it?

      "I've had my IUD for five weeks now, and it's made my life hell. I'm 20 years old and have suffered from extremely painful periods due to endometriosis for the past five years. The first day of my period was always horrible, as I had symptoms such as fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and diarrhea. I've passed out in public several times due to my period, and it's just been difficult to deal with, especially as I've gotten older. I constantly had to leave school due to my period, but now I'm at the age where I have certain responsibilities that I can't miss, such as work and college classes. I went on ortho tricyclen last August, and while it didn't cure my period symptoms, it made it slightly more manageable. I had no adverse side effects to it and overall enjoyed it. I met with an endometriosis specialist in March who diagnosed me after a pelvic MRI. She scheduled me for laparoscopic surgery in May and mentioned that she would be inserting an IUD. I had never previously considered getting an IUD because I didn't mind taking the pill. I'm not sexually active, and the thought of sticking some mental contraption in my uterus made me extremely uncomfortable. I told my surgeon that I would much rather continue taking birth control if it would help my symptoms, and she told me that the IUD was better because it would last at least five years. I wouldn't have to worry about it at all because it would be inserted during surgery, and apparently it's supposed to make period symptoms a lot more manageable. Fine. I said yes because I trusted my surgeon. I made it very clear to her that I no longer wanted to deal with this unbearable pain during my period because it caused a lot of stress in my life. I've missed out on a lot of things due to the pain. I've missed flights, had to quit jobs, and overall have felt embarrassed when I'm stuck in public when the symptoms hit. I was willing to have the IUD inserted because I thought it would improve the quality of my life.\n",

I can't do the things I enjoy because I'm in constant crippling pain. Before surgery, I dealt with flu-like symptoms once a month. It was horrible, but I would much rather prefer that to this sharp cramping every single day. I'm so upset because this procedure has only made the quality of my life so much worse. Honestly it's not even the procedure that did this. It's the fucking IUD. I have no clue why my surgeon pushed for it. She made me think that it would cure me. It's been difficult to get in contact with her despite constantly calling her ___OFFICE___. I told her the pain I've been experiencing, and she tells me that there can be cramping for 3-6 months post-insertion. So she tells me about the pain post-insertion?? She sold it to me as a painless solution. I told her I can't wait for it to \"maybe\" get better in 6 months because I have to go back to college next month, and I cannot come home until November.

      "I saw the doctor and he did a ultrasound and urine test. He saw nothing in my uterus, my urine test came out positive, but he was shocked to discover that I had my IUD still in the perfect place- nothing shifted! He requested for me to do blood work on June 8th since the labs were closed on the weekends. All weekend I was fine, little cramping and fatigue. After work this Monday, I stopped by to do blood work and found out on Tuesday that my HCG levels was at 1,063 ml (which means 5-6 weeks pregnant). They told to come in for an ___OFFICE___ visit on Wednesday- another ultrasound/blood work will be conducted. Tuesday night I had EXTREMELY BAD BLOATING ALL NIGHT. I kid you not, I felt like my stomach wanted to explode. Oh and bled consistently since Monday of this week. \n",

      "**DAY OF SURGERY**\n",
      "\n",
      "Wednesday around 4pm, as I drove and parked my car at the clinic/hospital- the sharp cramps hit me again and I cried before checking into the doctor's ___OFFICE___. The doctor did a vaginal examination to see if there was any discomfort/etc. then he did the ultrasound. When he did the ultrasound he was pretty silent. He pushed the machine away then proceeded to tell me that I was bleeding a lot and he needs to perform surgery the same day/in a few hours. He said I had a ectopic pregnancy and need to get it removed ASAP. I broke down in tears...none of my parents knew and it was last minute. I did not have any time to mentally prepare or process this madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told to contact my loved ones then to immediately transfer to the ER section of the hospital where my surgery will be held. After checking in I was required to wait a few hours until 8pm to get surgery because they need 6 hours since I have eaten food since 2pm. I waiting in this room on the bed where the nurses then the gynecologist read me my consent forms. The doctor said that he will conduct ***laparoscopy with partial salpingectomy***. Me at 23 not knowing WTH that is- he basically said he will most likely remove a part of my left ruptured Fallopian tube. My heart sank so HARD.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was waiting to get push over to the OR room, I asked around to different nurses if they allowed visitors- they ALL said NO VISITORS ALLOWED due to COVID-19. Of course, my family and boyfriend said they will still try. My family couldn't so they said they will just take my car home. Unexpectedly, I overheard some chatter of my name near my room and suddenly my boyfriend showed up sitting right next to me. He said he technically wasn't allowed but he \"smoothed\" his way in my getting tested for COVID. It was barely 10 minutes with my boyfriend then the nurse came in to tell me that they are going to take me to the OR. The OR room was so scary, I saw everything especially the huge lights- it was like I was some kind of cadaver or specimen. The bed they had me to move over was so narrow and small.\n",

      "I woke up in the hospital bed for recovery it was still Wednesday I did not know how much time has passed so I asked the nurse and it was 9:30pm- surgery was at 8pm. I was taken to my recovery room when I slept and cared for overnight. I was anxiously asking and waiting for when my doctor would come in to tell me about the results. All the nurses told me that the doctor comes in anytime and he probably sees patients depending on priority. I was like damn well I am already lonely enough with no loved ones near me and now I assume I am not a priority. \n",
      "\n",
      "I woke on on Thursday morning, ordered breakfast at the hospital, then exactly at 12pm the doctor came! He told me that he had to remove part of my left Fallopian tube which won't be functional anymore. The egg was trying to develop and grow in my left tube but got stuck- it got badly infected that burst. My two ovaries were still intact. I was internally bleeding up to 1 liter of blood. My IUD got removed. He said in the future and if I plan to get pregnant there will be a 10% risk of me having another ectopic pregnancy then on my RIGHT tube, but 90% of having normal pregnancy. With all that being said, my right tube is the only one functional right now. He recommended a different type of birth control after I recover, preferably pills. I was shortly discharged to go home an hour later.\n",

      "\n",
      "I came home yesterday feeling helpless and in a bit of pain. I had my sister to help bathe me and washed my hair. I just sobbed so much yesterday in my bed. My boyfriend came over to see me and I just could not stop crying then I cried in front of my family. I was emotionally traumatized. I honestly got the IUD without understanding that a ECTOPIC PREGNANCY would be one of them. I always thought, \"oh an IUD has up to a 99% success rate! I will give it all my trust\" It is hard to not beat myself over this even though it clearly was not my fault. Definitely did not want my first pregnancy to be like this but life happens and it teaches you a lot. I may be the unlucky 1% that got pregnant with the IUD but I need to realize that I am fortunate to still be fertile, alive, and to have a great support system. I am still in bed recovering right now...but I thought this would be a great way to share my experience with you all.\n",

      "Hi all,\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to share my experience with this sub as I relied on it quite heavily in the past and found other's stories so helpful. I'm currently 3.5 years into using the copper IUD (I have the 10-year model) and I'm now making plans for it removed as my husband and I are going to start TTC soon. Overall I've had a positive experience but there have certainly been aspects that only came up after the first year that I would have liked to know about before taking the plunge. This is super long but hopefully, some people might find it useful?\n",
      "\n",
      "**BC History:** After years of very irregular periods and terrible cystic acne during puberty, I started taking the combo-pill when I was 18. I continued trying various versions of the pill until I was about 24, which was when my mother was diagnosed with very early breast cancer. Obviously this isn't something that can be confirmed but her dr felt that my mother's very long term use of HBC had added to my mother's diagnosis. As such, I felt that I'd rather try using non-hormonal contraception to lower my chances. this was a very personal choice for me so YMMV, but for my own health I think this was the healthiest choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Insertion:** So before HBC, my periods had always been quite painful, so my baseline for cramps is quite high. That being said, I was more nervous about the insertion that I needed to be. Thankfully it went smoothly, which I do put down to having an incredibly experienced GP who was very familiar with the procedure. I wasn't sure what to expect so booked the afternoon off work just in case.  I did have some very mild cramping, sort of like a sense of low pressure in my abdomen, but honestly, I could have easily gone back into the ___OFFICE___. I also had spotting for maybe 4-5 days after insertion and then had my \"period\" as I would have expected about a week later. As I hadn't been off HBC for very long I don't regard this as a true period however.\n",
      "\n",
      "**First 6 months**: I was again quite lucky in that my cycle reverted to normal pretty much instantly. I was getting my period every 4 weeks, but I did notice that I was spotting almost a week before the \"full flow\". The cramps were the worst. The 2nd and 3rd cycles I had after insertion was bad enough that I called in sick on the peak days of cramping. The pain was bad enough that I couldn't really stand at full height and had to rely on heavy-duty painkillers to get through. I was also having the craziest flow of my life. You know when people jokingly refer to those scenes from Carrie or The Shining? Yeah. I was using max-flow tampons and pads at the same time and still had to change out once every 2 hours on my heavy days. Literally thought at one point that I'd managed to tear something and I was bleeding out. I called my GP who let me come in for a consultation and she asked that I give it another 2 cycles before having the IUD removed. She did prescribe me some tranexamic acid to help with the volume issue. I took that as prescribed for the next two cycles and then forgot to renew my order so cycle 4 was medication free. Weirdly my body seemed to have worked out how to regulate things on its own and I didn't need to take the tranexamic acid again. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other big issue I had in the first 6 months was my skin. Before I came off the pill I had literally never had better skin. It was amazing. now, without help from HBC, my skin is still acne-prone but from maybe my 3rd cycle post-insertion I started getting cystic acne along my chin and jawline again. I was able to use resources like r/SkincareAddiction to get my skin under control and thankfully I was successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6-12 Months:** So in months 6-12 I was still trying to get things under control like my skin and how to cope during my period. I was still getting really bad cramps but they were only lasting for maybe a day at a time so they were manageable. My flow had also calmed down and I started using a menstrual cup. Bit fiddly but I've not had any issues using that in tandem with the coil. It was also around this time that my husband commented that I was more emotional. It did feel like when I was on HBC my emotions were muted or toned down, and around 7 months off I suddenly started crying at sad adverts and such. Again, it took a little bit of time to adjust but apparently I'm quite a sensitive person now!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Year 1-2**: Okay so by this point I had my skin under control and had figured out most changes and adpted. That being said I was still getting very painful periods, though the cramps would only last 1 day. I then noticed that I was spotting more heavily. So while before it was maybe 5 days of bleeding, around the 1.5 year mark I suddenly started spotting for a week before my period was due, enough to require panty liners, and then my period would last 7 days, and I'd have spotting until CD12... To this day I don't know what that was about. I moved house around that time and had to find a new GP who was less supportive than my previous doctor, so I never really raised my concerns with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Year 3**: So I passed my 3 year anniversary in Feb this year, and if I wasn't planning to start TTC I'd be keeping it in. My cycles are still regular, if on the painful side, but they're no longer 7 days with spotting. More like 5 days with a tiny bit of spotting beforehand. I'm no longer having to double up on collection methods but my flow is still quite heavy and I do have to change out every 2 hours on the heaviest day. Most cycles I don't even need to take pain killers as the cramps are much better than they were before, and as time goes by it does feel less painful. That being said, every now and then I have a very bad cycle but it's far less frequent now. I've been very lucky in that my monthly string check has always been fine, and I've not had any cases of a wandering device or tearing. We'll have to see if my luck continues during removal but I'm feeling quite positive. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a really interesting experience and I feel much more in tune with my own body as a result of this. I would say however that my experience of pain lasted over a year, and it was only in the second year that I started having more manageable periods. My tolerance for pain is quite high, so I elected to continue on as I felt it was worth it, but I can totally understand why that may not suit all menstruating people. the biggest reason I've loved the IUD however is that it worked so well when my schedule was crazy. Travelling and forgot my pills? Not a problem. Networking event for work got heavy and I'm hungover? No need to worry about throwing up my pill now! My husband also said I'm a much nicer person to live with now that I'm not on HBC. Some of the brands I had tried made me either borderline suicidal or a living rage monster so to get control over my emotions again was really important to me and my marriage. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Tl:Dr** I think if you're very adamant about non-hormonal BC then this is a great option. You may have to let your body take a while to adjust however and it's a very personal choice as to whether or not it's worth it. I'm aware that I've been quite lucky in my experience so that does make me more inclined to suggest it to people, but I do think that more often than not it's a fantastic contraceptive method and is very safe to use.\n",

I've had some issues in the last couple years with menstruation - specifically, not having a period for months and months at a time, and then bleeding for months and months at a time.

      "Hi everyone! I wanted to create this post because over the past year, I really struggled with the Nexplanon implant and couldn't find much information or advice on dealing with it or what transitioning to an IUD would be like. \n",
      "\n",
      "**My Experience with the Nexplanon**\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to get the Nexplanon because unwanted pregnancy is a crippling fear of mine. The Nexplanon insertion was quick and painless. I was left with a small bruise that healed in days, and eventually transitioned into having sex without condoms without having to worry about pregnancy. HOWEVER, I almost always had to wear a pantyliner or pad, because there was about a 90% chance I would suddenly start spotting at any given point. The side effects I experienced on the Nexplanon were mood swings, acne and CONSTANT bleeding. I was already prone to hormonal acne pre-insertion, but I was willing to take the risk if it meant having a birth control method with very minimal insertion stress and super high efficacy. However, I ended up going on Accutane because my acne got so bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the bleeding - At first, this was very light spotting, but at the end, it was just a constant heavy period. I have seen posts by other concerned women on this nonstop bleeding, and I would like to relay that as long as you speak with your gynecologist and rule out all other sources of bleeding (infection, STDs, etc.), abnormal bleeding on the implant is one of the most common side effects, and besides being really annoying, is not actually harmful aside from POSSIBLY making you temporarily anemic (which you can treat with Iron supplements). This was the advice given to me directly from my gynecologist. You most likely will not need to rush to the ER over some irregular bleeding, so just be sure to speak with your gynecologist and have a pelvic exam/STD swab if recommended to you! If you continue to have irregular bleeding for 3 months after insertion, your gynecologist will likely prescribe you with a lose-dose birth control pill, such as lo-estro, to attempt to regulate the bleeding. This worked for me in the short term, but as soon as I finished a pill pack, the bleeding came back. As my doctor put it, it is usually only a bandaid for the underlying problem. Your first few months of having the implant are usually very indicative of how the rest of time having your implant with go. For some women, taking BC pills for a few months can actually fix their problems entirely. I did not want to continue taking birth control pills, because the combination pills prescribed to me contained both progestin and estrogen, meaning I was getting double the dose of progestin which really messed with my hormones, and I got the implant so I *wouldn't* have to take a pill everyday. \n",

      "It may sound silly that I endured these side effects for so long, but the fear of pregnancy and the fear of getting an IUD were so strong that I was willing to do anything to make the Nexplanon work for my body. Plus, every ‘solution’ had a trial period of about 3 months. I ended up taking birth control pills for around 7 months of the 12 that I actually had the Nexplanon. At the end of the day, my doctor recommended I have the implant removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Information about the Implant and the IUD Options I Was Given**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nexplanon implant is a progesterone-only birth control method. It is the only implant FDA-approved in the United States. The Nexplanon and Implanon are virtually the same, but the Nexplanon is actually the Implanon's replacement by the same manufacturer. In comparison, the Nexplanon's introduction came with an improved insertion device, which meant less room for insertion error, which means higher efficacy and easier insertion procedures. Furthermore, the Nexplanon is detectable by X-ray, while the Implanon was not (The Implanon \"XT\" is radiopaque, however!).  Because it is inserted into your arm, the progestin travels through your blood stream, causing a greater distribution of progestin in your body. In comparison, hormonal IUDs work directly in your uterus. It is hard to measure how much progestin actually reaches your uterus from the Nexplanon because it is a circulatory drug. Because the nexplanon does not contain estrogen, women like me who have constant bleeding as a side effect usually experience this because the uterine lining cannot stabilize/form from the lack of estrogen and will just keep shedding in result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nexplanon and birth control pills prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation, while the hormonal IUD works primarily by creating a cervical mucus plug which stops sperm from entering the uterus and secondarily by thinning the uterine lining. You are still ovulating while having a hormonal IUD, which is why periods either regulate, lighten and shorten or stop entirely for most women, because the uterine lining gets thinner and thinner over time, meaning less blood to shed and no where for an egg to attach! The likelihood of your period stopping entirely depends on the type of hormonal IUD you choose. The Mirena is the only recommended hormonal IUD for heavy periods and irregular bleeding because it contains such a high level of progesterone. Unfortunately, the Mirena is the largest, and therefore \\*potentially\\* most painful hormonal IUD to get inserted. The other types of hormonal IUDS recommended to me were Kyleena, Liletta and Skyla. The Skyla is rarely used anymore, because the Kyleena is seen as more convenient and came out as a replacement to the Skyla; the Kyleena contains a higher level of hormones and lasts 5 years rather than 3, and is the same size.   Some sources suggest that the Mirena could last up to 7 years, while the Liletta is only recommended for three to four. Mirena contains 52 mg of levonorgestrel, Liletta contains 52 mg of levonorgestrel, and Kyleena contains 19.5 mg of levonorgestrel and Skyla contains 13.5 mg. The Paraguard IUD is a nonhormonal option which lasts 10 years and operates by creating an inhospitable environment for sperm via its copper coil.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Switching from the Nexplanon to IUD**\n",
      "\n",
      "I ultimately chose to switch from the Nexplanon to the Kyleena IUD because I did not want to deal with the constant spotting anymore, and the Kyleena is one of the smallest IUDs with up to 5 years of protection from pregnancy. Before officially switching birth control methods, my gynecologist required that I attend a 1 hour information session on the different types of IUDs and how the procedure is done so that I would know what to expect. There, a doctor showed me and a few other young ladies a powerpoint with some of the information I have included above, passed around prototypes of the different IUDs so we could see what the real thing looks like in person, and she showed us the insertion tools and gave a demonstration on a Uterus and Ovary plastic model.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had my Kyleena insertion and Nexplanon removal in the same appointment. My doctor placed the IUD first to ensure that everything went smoothly before removing my primary form of BC.  Your arm is numbed for the Nexplanon removal so I did not feel anything, and I currently have a very small scar, hardly visible, on my arm from where it was extracted. The Kyleena insertion was quick and simple, and I was lucky to not experience much pain - just minor discomfort, a rolling, NOT sharp cramp. I was terrified going in, but actually asked the gynecologist, \"Wait, it's already over?\" when she was finished inserting my IUD. I was diligent in taking the recommended ibruprofen before and after the procedure, and used a heating pad to dull the cramps once at home. I know that all women are different, so again, I must stress that YMMV. The cramps lasted for a few hours, and I felt 100% the net day. \n",
      "\n",
      "**My experience with the Kyleena**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not had an actual period since getting my Kyleena inserted. I had minor spotting a week after insertion, and so far, that's all I have had. I have not had any other side effects. Since clearing on Accutane, my acne did not resurge with the change in birth control methods. I would 100% recommend trying the Kyleena to anyone considering it! \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my main gynecologist and the one who performed the procedure if it was necessary for me to consistently check my IUD strings, and they both told me no. My primary GYN said that because the strings soften significantly, and oftentimes 'tuck' up, women will come into the ___OFFICE___ freaking out that their IUD is gone when usually they just can't feel it. My partner felt a small poke of the strings when we first had sex after insertion (a week later I think?) and since then, the strings have softened, and he only occasionally feels them with no pain to either of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TLDR;** I had the Nexplanon for over a year and tried almost everything to counteract the side-effects. Did a lot of my own research and asked a lot of questions along the way. Had to go on Accutane to combat the hormonal acne. Finally switched to the Kyleena after conquering my fears of the insertion, and I don't regret a thing from this entire experience.\n",

      "Please feel free to ask me any questions about my experience with Accutane, the Nexplanon and Kyleena if you would like. I hope that this post is helpful to someone, because it's exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find a couple months back when I needed it.

      "For a little back story, I went earlier this month for two visits related to an external cyst (my first gyno visits ever). I'm 22, live at home, don't have a driver's license, have parents who like control, and grew up in a rather non-sex positive household to parents who are also in the medical field. My parents claim to be hippies, but unfortunately live in the south, and the ideologies that come with the area have rubbed off on them over the years. It was a struggle just to get a visit to gynecologist, and I had to explain in detail what was going on with me to my parents in order for them to agree. It took two separate pleas to my mother. The first she needed to know my sexual history before she would agree to drive me, this was before I admitted the reason was for a cyst. The second time, a few month later when I couldn't take it anymore, I told my mother it was about a cyst. She agreed. I'll skip the first two visits because the details are kinda a bore and graphic. But I will say it went well other than my mother insisting on being in the waiting room with me. There was also a talk on the way to the first visit about how the doctors and nurses would push birth control on me. They didn't and it didn't come up once. I actually wanted that to happen badly for years, because protecting myself is pretty important to me. I'm 22 for ffs.\n",

      "Skip to last week, I got the nerve up to call my gynecologist ___OFFICE___ and made a follow up appointment to check how everything was healing. Only I didn't need this, that's what I told my mother. She got pissed and a flood of excuses came on why I should cancel the appointment. I told her that I can always get one of my brothers to give me a ride, but she didn't take me seriously. I was dead serious. So I made arrangements with my brother. I'm pretty sure she knew what was up. The day for my appointment came yesterday, and I tried to get out of the house before I got an earful, but my father stopped us on the way out. I'll spare the details, but he didn't think going out was a good idea. The drive went fine and my brother slept in the car while I handled my appointment. I got in pretty fast and discussed with my gyno about what I wanted and what options I was left. No shame. No talking me into different options. Just strict professionalism. I left pretty happy, until I got to the car and reality sunk in. I was going to get a talking to when I got home. When I got there my mother was gritting her teeth ready to start a fight, but luckily had to fix lunch for my younger sibling. I also don't think she wanted to look like the bad guy in front of my younger sibling. I'll commend her for that. She did make a few comments but let it slide mostly. Unfortunately I have a follow up appointment for the darn thing to be put in (Nexplanon) so I have to go through this process again.\n",

She showed me the IUD, measured my uterus, and then inserted it and trimmed the strings. She let me know when there would be pressure and warned me that it would be uncomfortable, I focused on my breathing and while it was uncomfortable it was not unbearable... I would say 7 out of 10 for less than 30 seconds. The doctor did comment on how well I handled it. I was not lightheaded or anything after, maybe a little sweaty/clamy from nerves but that was it. I left the doctors ___OFFICE___ and walked down the street for a coffee and pastry before heading home. I had ensured I was stocked with ibuprofen/acetaminophen/pain killers, heating pads, and overnight pads.

I experienced light spotting for a couple days after, however my period was also the week after insertion (got it inserted on a Friday and period was due Tuesday) so I do not know if that contributed to it.

      "\n",
      "My first was Kyleena, and I got it inserted (Feb 2018) at my University women's health clinic. It took them 30 MINUTES to get it in. They kept having trouble as my cervix was \"positioned funny.\" That was some of the worst pain I have ever felt, and it was honestly a bit traumatic if I'm being honest. They also never ultrasounded afterward, but the longer I had the IUD the more frequently I got this very sharp cramps in both my uterus and ovaries just randomly. By Dec 2019, I had my IUD checked by an actual OBGYN ___OFFICE___ and it turns out my IUD had slipped into my cervix. Because of this, I had it removed, but I was quite upset because I am fairly certain they did not place the IUD properly. I could've gotten pregnant, or worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had gone on oral bc in January, but I had horrible emotional side effects (worsened depression and anxiety, mood swings, etc) and I was gaining weight all while I was on a study abroad so I stopped taking them in March. I felt tremendously better off of any birth control. I felt like I could think clearly again and manage my mental health much better. I was much more laid back and actually felt like I was myself again, but I did not like that I only had condoms as a contraceptive method and therefore basically was abstinent by choice. \n",
      "\n",

      "In early June 2020, I opted to get a Mirena inserted. The Mirena insertion was the same level of pain as the Kyleena, but much quicker. It probably only too her 10 minutes max start to finish. Unfortunately, Mirena also gave me horrible mood side effects including almost uncontrollable irritability, horrible nightmares, worsened depression, skyrocketing anxiety,  and overall I felt like a completely different person. I actually did not realize that it was the Mirena at first until I tracked when the symptoms started. I also realized that I had similar, but not as severe side effects after I had Kyleena inserted: this was the same time my problems with a long-term boyfriend started occuring. These realizations were powerful for me to realize, but also very sad. I think my change in demeanor from Kyleena might have contributed  not only to the end of that relationship, but to the loss of my best friend. I got Mirena removed three weeks after insertion, and my symptoms started clearing up in less than three days. \n",

I got my Paraguard inserted yesterday and it was the best insertion experience I have had. The provider did it in under 5 minutes and it was basically only two big cramps within the process (measuring and the actual insertion).

Everything's fine, the midwife was adorable and really reassured me. She informs me I'll have to come back one month after that to see if the IUD is well set and I don't have any other issues linked to the device, like, I don't know, a freaking infection. Ahah.\n",

      "OBGYN #1: Scheduled with a female Dr. because I was uncomfortable with a male Dr. (no history of assault or anything, but just anxious it might cause trauma if he was creepy - rational? not really. but again anxiety). I told Dr. I wasn't sexually active but planning to be. She scoffed and was like \"then why do you want an IUD?\" (red flag #1: your Dr. shouldn't make you feel less than for wanting to be prepared). I told her I had stretched myself out with toys so the speculum shouldn't be too bad. She looked really uncomfortable talking about the topic of sex with me (like isn't that her specialty ???) and said they didn't usually do IUD's for people who haven't had children LET ALONE people who haven't had sex (because god forbid being 21 and a virgin and honest abt it). She also then told me they didn't offer paraguard anymore, only hormonal IUDs (Red flag #2 : bad ___OFFICE___ communication. I was told numerous times they offered it over the phone, but then in person they said they didn't). I asked if she would do a pap smear, but she said also no because I wasn't sexually active. (You need one for an IUD regardless of your sexual history). I did express my concerns about any hormones in my body. **She said because the IUD hormones are just in your uterus, not your whole body, the effects aren't as strong as the pill.** Eased my fears a bit, but still not what I wanted. She also offered a BC pill prescription until I had sex, but I wasn't really interested. Back to the drawing board. \n",
      "\n",
      "OBGYN #2: Much better doc overall. She was very sweet and explained all of my options to me thoroughly. She said she would explain each option without bias, (a caution flag??? I feel like as soon as someone says that, especially a Dr, it's a caution flag because shouldn't Drs do that anyway?) Regardless, she explained with some bias that her patients much prefer the NuvaRing. I knew I didn't want that bc hormones, and its like in my vag chillin and it could work for some, but I didn't want to deal. For IUDs, she said she didn't like the copper IUD because it was really big to insert, especially compared to the Skyla (a smaller hormonal IUD). She showed me what the insertion tool looked like side by side (the skyla is smaller, but the difference wasn't that drastic). She also said **with any IUD, getting an STD isn't great because it can get into your reproductive system and cause damage.**  By at the end of the appt. she had me convinced Paraguard would be really really painful. She also didn't have any IUDs in-___OFFICE___ so I had to pick one to order. I chose the Skyla (against my intuition). But, at the end of the appt after the order was placed she said it would take about 3-4 weeks for it to come in. (I'm going back to college in 3 weeks so that wasn't going to work, but I hoped it would get in quickly). When I said I wasn't sexually active but wanted to be, she was hesitant on the pap, but gave me a full-body checkup and a pap. Very glad a woman did this because she had me disrobe, check my breasts for any abnormal lumps, etc. Nudity doesn't bother me, but this was the first time anyone has seen me naked or inspected my vagina so I think a male would've been more intimidating. \n",

I went in originally just for a consultation. I told them prior to the appt I was on my period and I already had a pap. Would it be possible to insert it that day? I was told no because Dr. had to take cultures first. So, I planned to go in, get cultures, and ask for a pill prescription.

I don't typically get breast leakage during ovulation but it's happened as a result of medication before (that's a story for another day, but it was linked to the hormone 'prolactin' being too high).

      "TL;DR: I had a Nexplanon implant for three years that I loved, so I got a second. Within the first month of the second implant I became depressed, had little interest in anything (including my partner), and was a miserable human. After a long fight, I had it taken out. I haven’t been on hormonal birth control since and I feel like my normal self. I’m finally happy again. \n",
      "\n",
      "——-\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I received my first Nexplanon implant in March of 2015. Initially I was very off-put at the abnormality of my cycle, but compared to the pill my overall response was more positive. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the first six months I had a period. Constantly. It wasn’t the best, but wasn’t terrible. Mostly annoying. Also something I anticipated. From there, I began to notice that my cycle was 45 days off followed by 14-21 days on. I got used to it and greatly enjoyed my Nexplanon implant. I kept it for the full three years. \n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2018, I had my Nexplanon replaced with a new dose. I had anticipated the abnormal bleeding, but I did not anticipate other side effects. Unfortunately, I became very depressed within the first month. From March until September I kept my struggle to myself. I was in denial about it being my birth control because the first implant went really well. I no longer found my long-term partner attractive. We very rarely had sex. I didn’t want him to touch me. I was not interested in my research work towards my dissertation. I didn’t want to partake in my usual hobbies. I was honestly probably a miserable person to deal with. \n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t until sometime in September during a fight with my partner that I realized how bad I had gotten. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor. She referred me to my GYN to discuss my birth control. \n",
      "\n",
      "My GYN was very dismissive. Almost angry that I had suggested my birth control could be making me depressed. She refused to take it out or prescribe me other medication. I went back to my primary doctor and we decided that I would try some lifestyle changes, like social outings and exercise. \n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to work for several months. Now I can admit I was in denial during the end of 2018 and most of 2019, but at the time I pretended everything was okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "I still had the same terrible outlook that I mentioned above. Additionally, I started having the most terrible thoughts enter my mind at the most random times. Cooking dinner- “what if you entire family died in a house fire?” Driving to class- “what if you got into an accident and no one came to help?” These were the most terrible unprovoked thoughts. \n",
      "\n",
      "I truly felt like I was “crazy”. \n",
      "\n",
      "In November of 2019, I went back to my doctor. She insisted it was the Nexplanon and my GYN needed to revisit. Because my primary doctor and GYN were both at my university’s ___OFFICE___, my primary doctor called upstairs and told my GYN that the implant needed to be taken out that day. \n",
      "\n",
      "My GYN still put up a fight. “What if we tried the pill with Nexplanon?” “What if we prescribed an anti-depressant?” Now, neither of these are “wrong” options. I just wanted my body to be able to reset. So, even though it was absolutely terrifying, I insisted. I said I wasn’t leaving until it was out. So, it came out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then I have been birth control free. No hormones whatsoever. Almost immediately my sex drive came back. I wanted affection. I didn’t have those terrible thoughts. I wanted to see friends. I was engaged at work and school. I felt like a new person. I also realized how miserable I had been for the past year and a half. \n",
      "\n",
      "My advice to anyone out there who feels like they’re struggling because of birth control is to talk to your doctor. If they push back and say that you’re wrong, insist. If they refuse, find another doctor. If anything, talk to someone you trust. Someone who would never lie to you or give you bad advice, and listen to them.\n",

The first 6 months I was very emotional and I had anxiety. It’s hard to tell if it was because of life changes (getting married, graduating college, new job stress, etc) or from the birth control. It eventually leveled off and I didn’t have any other problems. Period was a bit irregular and cramps were not nearly as bad as before I got the implant. \n",

I threw up and couldn’t snap out of it. I had to stay in the ___OFFICE___ for an extra 15-20 minutes because every time I tried to stand up I would feel like I’m gonna faint.

I screamed because it was such a surprise and also hurted. Then the nurse said that I should start the music and in the same moment ( I couldn't answer her) I felt such a hard cramp and I screamed ( I'm sorry for all the women and girls in the building). It hurted so bad for about 5 seconds I think. After that he was ready and I was in literal shock. I couldn't move myself.

About one hour before my appointment I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen. \n",

Day 3 was flowier and then days 4 and 5 were a heavier flow than normal with some pretty bad cramping. But it wasn’t as heavy or painful as I was fearing. I went through 2 regular pads on each of these days. Day 6 was a lighter flow and then I had light spotting that annoyingly stuck around for 4 more days. \n",

I tried to relax as much as I could and push as much fluids as possible. Being I have Two kids to look after and take care of it was hard for me to get a chance to really relax. Every chance I got to relax I did so though. Around I’d say 11:30AM OR SO. I took my son upstairs , and felt sharp like stabbing pains and then BOOM there it was in my room on the floor covered in blood. Ever since it came out I have been cramping really bad, bleeding and very gassy ! I can’t call my docs ___OFFICE___ until tomorrow being they are closed weekends. I just want to know any experiences from women and there Paragard or any other intrauterine devices they’ve had that this happened or just maybe one that they like ? I’m considering the nuvaring... but it seems as though the one above doesn’t have being on birth control in my pathway. I’m just confused as to why this happened to me !!  Please leave comments !\n",

The doctor never told me she was going to put a clamp on my cervix, and the pain was unbearable, I started crying and almost threw up because it hurt so bad. So she stopped, and then had the audacity to say she didn’t know why it hurt me so bad, because most women didn’t complain, and that the IUD insertion would be much worse. I told her she gave me no warning, and she said that if I couldn’t handle that, then maybe an IUD isn’t for me, then she just left the room. Honestly, I still feel completely violated by the whole ordeal, she caused me severe pain without telling me about it then chastised me for even being in pain. \n",

      "The head doctor/owner of my gynecologist’s ___OFFICE___ called me a few days later and told me the other doctor had told her I had a very small cervix and a retroverted uterus, so she had a put a clamp on it. She never told me any of this of course, but she put it in my notes. \n",

      "Yesterday, I took the muscle relaxer which made me feel really weird (like mentally I was wide awake, but my body was so tired), and went to my appointment. I explained to her what happened and she was really upset because she thought the other doctor had explained the procedure to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "She walked me through the entire thing and with the lidocaine gel, I didn’t feel the clamp at all. The insertion was very painful, definitely the worst cramps I’ve ever felt in my life, but it wasn’t a constant terrible pain like the clamp was, so it was easier to deal with. She measured my uterus and the pain only lasted about 2 seconds, then the pain from the insertion only lasted about 5-10 seconds, and that was it! It was in, she cleaned me up, helped me sit up, and it was over! So from the time she put the speculum in to sitting up wasn’t even 5 minutes. \n",

      "I’ve only had it in for 2 days, and I’m spotting, but so far the worst part is cramping and hip pain. It feels like cramps from a terrible period, I also get the same hip pain then, so I’m sure the cramps are causing it. \n",
      "\n",

      "I know a lot of people are really curious about the experience &amp; procedure. I just got home from my insertion and wanna share while it’s fresh on my mind!!\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I peed in a cup for a quick pregnancy test prior to insertion. The IUD insertion starts with a speculum, which we all know is a little uncomfortable. Next, she cleaned off my cervix with basically a big q tip/cotton swab. The cervix stabilizer clamp after that wasn’t bad at all. I’ve heard some people say it was the worst part for them and genuinely I wasn’t bothered by it. If anything could describe how it felt for me, it was just annoying honestly. She sounded my cervix to measure my uterus which was uncomfortable as well. It felt like a cramp, a very sudden cramp, but I’d compare it to how I felt yesterday morning on my period. I told her “it feels like I have to take a shit.” She told me that my uterus is tilted back a little bit and that that’s why it made me feel like I had to poop. Which also explains my weird almost butthole pain that I get with cramps... it’s my dang uterus!! I could feel when she got to the end of my uterus, which wasn’t pleasant by any means, but not the worst pain I’ve ever been in. To be real with y’all, the uterus measurement and the IUD insertion were really just pressure and not pain. The final step was inserting the IUD. She told me to cough at this point (I was masked, Covid is real y’all!) That was comparable to the measurement aspect, but not very different. I felt the wings of the IUD spread out, which wasn’t pleasant either, but again, was more of a really intense pressure rather than a sharp pain kind of deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would compare my experience with having penetrative sex and having your cervix hit a lot (which can feel good!) but after a while it just gets kind of sore and the pressure starts to feel uncomfortable. I learned my uterus was tilted back which is pretty cool! And explains why my period symptoms feel like I’ve had far too much dairy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that, my doctor actually suggested to take a month or two of birth control pills to prevent a lot of spotting and such. She said to take them for a month, and then after that will be my appointment to check the strings and make sure everything is all good, so we’ll reevaluate then. I thought that that was kind of a genius idea, minus the fact that I switched methods because I couldn’t remember to take my pills on time everyday, and sometimes forgot completely. I lost my pack mid way through and realized I needed a better option than what I was using to prevent pregnancy, which is what led me to an IUD.\n",
      "\n",
      "About me personally: my periods before birth control lasted about 8 days, never came in a manner in which they could be predicted, and weren’t heavy but weren’t light either. I’d say I had a medium flow. I started birth control (combo pill) at 18, and went 2 months during college without it (too busy to get a new prescription for it). My periods then were unbearable, left me bedridden with pain, and to go anywhere I had to be bent over at a 90° angle. Not fun! My period as of the past 2 days, without being on birth control for about 2 months, is intense. Stabbing pains in my uterus AND ovaries, a pain close to my butthole that I now know is my uterus just being a meanie, and some intense nausea which usually can be curbed by snacking and eating alllllllll day long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before my insertion: I took 800mg of Ibuprofen about an hour before my appointment time (i had a 45 minute drive there &amp; left a bit early in case of traffic, so i took it right before i left my house). I also took my as needed prescribed anti anxiety medication (0.5mg alprazolam which is pretty much Xanax) at the same time as the ibuprofen due to my fear of gynecological visits. Last night before bed I was prescribed Misoprostol to dilate my cervix a bit and make everything with the insertion process a little bit easier for my provider and a little less painful for me. I can’t say whether or not this helped, because I’ve never had an IUD before today, and because I’ve never taken this medicine before. But considering how I handled the insertion so well, it may have been a contributing factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reference of my pain scale: I’ve happily gotten both of my nipples pierced twice. The first time felt like my entire body was tearing apart, while the second time was almost like piercing your ear lobes. Not bad at all! I’d say that I’d rank the insertion as being in between those pain scales. Though again, it was an intense pressure rather than a pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "How am I doing right now?: I have been taking 600mg of ibuprofen to rid me of my period cramps. Since I took 800mg this morning, my period cramps were gone by the time I got to the doctor’s ___OFFICE___. Right now, I’m cramping a bit but nothing intolerable. I’d like to take more ibuprofen but I’m waiting 6 hours since I last took it, so I’ll take 800mg again at 2:30pm. This is about the cramping level where I’d decide to take medicine just because I know my cramps would get worse, but since I already took some medicine I’ll have to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pain? Cramps? Symptoms as of right now?: I have cramps like normal, the weird almost butthole cramp that is my uterus being rude, some lower back cramps, nothing abnormal for my period. I was a little nauseous at the end of the insertion, but my period makes me nauseous. I did eat before my visit, but wasn’t able to get down much because of my anxiety. I’ll be eating lunch soon since it’s already close to 11:30am. I am still a teensy bit nauseous, and should probably have a snack while I wait for lunch time as I’d normally do on my period. I can kind of feel where the IUD is placed which I’m sure may last a few days, but I’m not worried about it. It’s like a small pressure at the moment just because there’s something there that normally isn’t and my uterus is probably annoyed by it on top of being poked and prodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: genuinely dude I was way more anxious than anything. I was a little nervous due to the fact that I’ve read both positive and negative stories. Mostly I was just nervous because I always get nervous for gyno visits (i have a history of sexual trauma, so gyno visits can be a little bit more uncomfortable than they may be for the average gal) but my provider is awesome in that she talks to me the whole time and remembers me as a patient, so it makes it a lot more of a comfortable environment. I’d say just be prepared to be a little bit anxious, it’s okay! It happens to the best of us. The worst part of this will more than likely just be your worries about it!! Try to keep calm, focus on your breathing, cover your eyes to calm down, or just communicate with your provider while it’s happening! I covered my eyes just to keep myself calm and my muscles relaxed.\n",

Both times, it got to a point where I felt so numb, and began to experience suicidal thoughts (very VERY uncharacteristic for me) that got so bad I just discontinued use. Both times, my mood improved within a few days to a week of the discontinuation.\n",

So I went to my PCP and of course her only suggestion was Metformin and BC. I told her about my past hormonal BC experiences and she assured me the pill she would be prescribing me wouldn’t have those effects. She put me on Sprintec and prescribed it to skip the placebo pills to ensure I wouldn’t ovulate.\n",

My mood stayed pretty good, but I began to experience extreme pain with sex and was not able to self-lubricate anymore.

I called my doctors ___OFFICE___ and they told me they won’t bill my prescription insurance or allow me to have one shipped to them. They essentially told me I had to pay the full cost and refused to help further. It is annoying, as I am a HDHP patient and I pay a lot of money directly to the doctor’s ___OFFICE___ every time I go. I have a serious GYN issue that I have already spent $1,200 at their ___OFFICE___ this year. Each visit alone is $90. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I took matters into my own hands and called every OB/GYN in my area until I found a small practice who was willing to help me. They are working through the authorizations for me now and I couldn’t be happier with them or more furious with my previous doctor. Looks like I might have to get familiar with a new OB. Here is to hoping it all works out and I can get back to having a normal body.\n",

      "I (26F) got the Kyleena inserted yesterday evening. It was 9 days after the start of my period so I was no longer bleeding. I was extremely nervous about getting an IUD and unfortunately due to some medical reasons I am unable to do the pills. SO, my options  given to me were condoms or IUD. While condoms are fine, I wanted to feel a little bit more secure in knowing I won't have a baby in the foreseeable future. I am getting married soon and while kids may be in the future, I don't want one now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like most people I read all the awful experiences people had and the positive experiences too. When I got to the doctor, they had me do a pregnancy test just to check before insertion that I wasn't pregnant. My doctor wasn't my normal doctor because I normally see a nurse practitioner in the ___OFFICE___ and she doesn't do insertions. He showed me everything he was going to do, with the inserter tube and the actual iud. He asked me if I had questions or concerns and was just very thorough in his answers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The actual insertion was uncomfortable. Most people say the slight pinch was the worst because it was dilating your cervix and holding it open. That was fine for me. It wasn't super uncomfortable. The worst was when he measured my uterus and then actually inserted the iud. It was painful but bearable and went by super fast. He then did an ultrasound to make sure it was placed properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did take ibuprofen before hand because I was nervous of the pain. I did cramp when it was inserted but I have had worse while on my period. I felt fine last night and had very little discharge.  This morning, I have felt fine. A few cramps after I walked across the college campus I work at. I feel a little tender and swollen but no pain and no bleeding. I hope it will stay this easy. \n",

Two years on the pill, and both years my cholesterol levels were slightly higher than normal. Last year, I thought it was because I ate before the blood test (had a late appointment and couldn't starve till 4PM) and it threw the numbers off but this year I fasted and it's still the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any possibility that BC can raise cholesterol levels? Or is it just due to getting older/gaining 10 pounds? I don't think I eat horribly but I def don't work out as much as I should. (I have a sedentary ___OFFICE___ position)\n",

However, one ovary and the surrounding area have been under a considerable amount of pressure the past few days (did not experience when IUD was initially placed). I was previously on the pill, and it’s my understanding that this may be pain from ovulation, but it’s been a few days of this and I wasn’t really ovulating prior to taking the pill, nor have I ever had an ovary cramp like this. I called the doctor’s ___OFFICE___ and they said to take otc pain killers and use a heating pad unless the pain becomes unbearable, in which case go to the emergency room. I’ve checked my strings and they’re still there, so my next stop is to request an ultrasound to make sure everything is still good in there. Has anyone else had a similar experience?\n",

      "Hey y'all! This sub helped me SO much when I was getting ready to get my IUD inserted, and the positive experiences helped me to feel much more at ease going into my insertion, so I wanted to share my experience and what I did to hopefully help others feel a bit better about it too! :) It's also worth mentioning that I have a retroverted (tilted) uterus, so it can sometimes make the insertion a bit more challenging, and even *my* experience was so much better than I expected :)\n",
      "\n",
      "My appointment was at 8:00 am, so it helped to limit how much time I had to be anxious about the procedure which was great! About an hour before my appointment, I took 600mg of Ibuprofen, and made sure to eat a full breakfast so that I wouldn't feel woozy or unwell from being hungry. I also bought a heating pad (highly recommend!) beforehand so that I could use it as soon as I got home :)\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to my doctor's ___OFFICE___, after COVID screening, I needed to give them a urine sample so that they could do a pregnancy test. After that, I just sat down with my doctor to discuss any last-minute questions and how the procedure would go, and then it was go time! \n",
      "\n",
      "After laying down on the exam table with my feet in stirrups, my doctor slowly inserted the speculum (this was my first ever speculum exam so I was nervous) and it was nowhere near as bad as I expected - I only felt a bit of pressure, but it didn't hurt at all. He then performed a few tests, and cleaned my cervix with an iodine antiseptic solution. After this was done, he inserted the sound, a device used to measure the depth of your uterus. When he did this, I felt a huge cramp from the moment that it went through the top of my cervix and into the uterus (felt like a very sharp period cramp), but I made an effort to focus entirely on my breathing, and before I knew it, that step was over. After this, my doctor loaded the IUD into the insertion tube, and told me to take a few deep breaths, then he began to insert it into my cervix. The actual insertion took longer than the sounding step, but I'd say it was the same pain level (8 out of 10). He then cut the strings, removed the speculum, and after discussing a few next steps, I was on my way home! \n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, for the first several hours I felt a lot of pressure, but not actual cramps. Once the cramps started later on, not gonna lie, they were a bit intense, but ibuprofen helped A LOT and made them super manageable. 6 days out, I'm still cramping and do have a bit of spotting, but it has been much better than the first day or two of cramps! It helps a lot if you take the ibuprofen BEFORE your pain starts, so write down your dosage time and take the next dose as soon as you can (for the first one or two days based on your pain levels) so that it can't wear off all the way :)\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall yes, it hurts (a fair bit) but it's over SO quickly, and was definitely not as bad as I expected it to be! I would 100% do it over again if this method ends up working well for me!! I'd be more than happy to answer literally any questions that anybody has about IUD insertions or my experience :)\n",

      "\n",
      "I did not take ibuprofen prior to the appointment on any kind of a schedule (definitely should have) but the ___OFFICE___ gave me ibuprofen upon arrival when I checked in for my insertion. I took it maybe just 15 minutes before insertion. Again, I would recommend navigating an ibuprofen schedule for the day leading up to the appointment — especially if you have the time and it’s in the afternoon. \n",
      "\n",
      "They had me get undressed from the waist down and get on the table seated on a disposable chux.\n",
      "\n",
      "It started with the speculum, which made me feel as though I was going to have a bowel movement but, thankfully, I did not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the gyno said I would feel some pressure as she gave me a swipe with the stuff to prevent infection upon insertion (I can’t remember what it’s called!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said I would feel pressure again and a pinch this time as she was measuring my cervix and getting a line of sight to my uterus for device placement. This was mostly just uncomfortable. The pinch certainly was a pinch but no worse than the pinch you would feel when getting novocaine at the dentist. \n",
      "\n",
      "When it came time for the insertion, my gyno said I would feel pressure then a cramp, and she was right. It was a strong cramp and then I was significantly uncomfortable and didn’t realize right away that I was saying, “oh, my God, oh, my God” out loud and I truly thought I was just saying it in my head. I could feel cramping but it was mostly massive, massive pressure for about 30 seconds. My gyno then clipped the strings a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when the gyno removed everything, specifically the speculum, I immediately felt hot and sweaty, then freezing. As I was going through these physiological reactions she was vocalizing them to me as they were happening (like she could read my mind!) and reassuring me this was a normal feeling with blood pressure changes as a natural response and to not get up. She told me to remain lying down until the medical assistant came in in a few minutes to check on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my gyno stepped out of the room, I remained lying down and continued to cycle through hot and cold and sweaty and began feeling the dull and achey cramping. This lasted for about 5 minutes and ebbed and flowed in intensity but was OK so as long I stayed still. As I thought the cramping was settling, I began to have sharp and stabbing cramps that caused me to grab onto my thighs pretty hard because I needed to redirect the pain somewhere. It was fairly intense. I wasn’t crying per se at this point but my eyes were watering heavily and I couldn’t think about anything else during that time except how much it hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As those subsided after about 3 minutes, the MA knocked to come in and brought me a juice box. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would strongly suggest that you attempt to take a few sips while still lying down as best as you can and slowly sit up after those first few sips. Upon sitting up, take a few deep breaths and a few more sips of the juice box. Then slowly get up off the table. I stood for a moment just to regain my balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was left a pad by the MA and was then brought to an ultrasound tech room just down the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not anticipate the ultrasound to be internal, as I thought it would be external. Alas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The internal ultrasound was fairly uncomfortable but at this point my vagina, cervix, and uterus had gone through a lot not too long beforehand so it makes sense it would be generally unpleasant. It lasted maybe 5 minutes or less. The tech took pictures of the IUD and its placement to ensure it all looked good, then took photos of the rest of my uterus, as well as my ovaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I got dressed again and made my 4-week follow up appointment and that’s where I’m at currently. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I made the appointment initially for insertion, I went back and forth between a morning or afternoon appointment. I would suggest an afternoon appointment if you’re able to do that. While everyone has different experiences with insertion and pain level, taking the rest of the afternoon for yourself regardless of the overall experience is just a good idea. It’s a lot to go through all in one day and you deserve some R&amp;R after! \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I got in my car to leave, I blasted the AC and sat with my face right up to the vent for a few minutes. I was still going between hot and cold and sweating profusely. I had some cramping still at this point but nowhere near what the pain was when I was in the gyno’s ___OFFICE___. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arriving back home, I took ibuprofen and just sat watching Netflix until bedtime. The cramping was still dull and achey. I did wake up in the middle of the night the first night (Thursday into Friday) and was not comfortable. I was up for a few hours. I did feel better when I went to the bathroom and it’s likely a fuller bladder was causing some added pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m staying very hydrated and trying to urinate as often as possible to keep the pressure from my bladder down. I’m still cramping but Friday I was able to go to work for the day and didn’t experience any cramping. However, it is currently the wee hours of Saturday morning and I am cramping and awake because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is now Saturday, Aug. 15 and I can say I feel a bit better. The cramping is still there but it typically occurs in the middle of the night (which makes sense as I’m not routinely taking ibuprofen during sleep hours as I am during awake hours). \n",
      "\n",
      "I was on day 2 of my menstrual cycle for insertion and had a heavier flow that day and my standard cycle runs Wednesday-Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday, Aug. 14, all I experienced was the faintest bit of spotting that really couldn’t even be considered spotting. That would be generous. \n",

      "\n",
      "Before any examination, I talked with my doctor about all of my BC options. From the pill, the patch, the injection, and everything else, my doctor explained every one, along with a general idea of some side effects and how the birth control worked. I originally asked for the Paraguard (copper) IUD, however after talking to my doctor, we decided on the Skyla. (This was mostly due to size- the Paraguard is large and would be more difficult and potentially more painful to get into my uterus. She said that her teenagers seemed to really enjoy their Skyla, so with her advice, that’s the route I chose.)\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I had a quick woman’s check (my first ever), which was painless and easy. Here, I also got an STI check, and my OB said that if you can’t handle the STI swab, you probably couldn’t do great at the UID. (not that it’s impossible, but it can be a good indicator that the IUD will be quite painful/ uncomfortable) For me, the STI check felt like someone used their fingernail and lightly scratched a circle around the top of my vagina. \n",

      "Insertion:\n",
      "\n",
      "I showed up to my OB’s ___OFFICE___ and did the regular pre-checks (blood pressure, weight, etc) and then I had to pee in a cup for a pregnancy test, and then it was time! I was really nervous and talked to my nurse about some of the horror stories I had read online. Then my doctor came into the room, and the insertion began! My doctor did a great job of telling me all that was going on and what was about to happen which was very nice! \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the speculum was inserted, and I had the same “need to pee” sensation as before. Then, my doctor cleaned my cervix with an iodine solution, and this is to keep the vaginal/cervical bacteria out of the uterus. Honestly, I didn’t feel this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the worst parts. First is the measuring of the uterus. Honestly, the tool looks like a straw. Anyway, most people find this to be the most painful part, however it really didn’t bother me at all. I had a little pressure, but other than that, I didn’t feel a whole lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it was time to insert my Skyla! It didn’t hurt when the applicator was inserted, but I did have a decent cramp right after the insertion. Overall though, my period cramps are worse, and I have mild cramps. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was the process uncomfortable? A bit. But was it painful? Not for me. My doctor did note that I was quite tough, so I feel like I’m an outlier to experience little pain. I do have a pretty high pain tolerance, (e.g. I had all 4 wisdom teeth removed and didn’t tale any pain meds) But maybe my story can be a genuinely no pain- extremely easy experience to provide someone a bit of an ease of mind. \n",

      "For a girl who grew up in the Deep South, where sex-before-marriage was just as bad as murder, my IUD has made me feel like a superhero. I know that sounds a little insane, but here's what you have to understand: for the longest time, my mom told me if I ever got pregnant, she'd kick me out of the house — even after we left the church and organized religion. And of course, it never helped that my family considered getting pregnant before being married as the Ultimate Sin™️. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, I have always had extreme anxiety about becoming pregnant. It has completely turned me off to ever wanting children. With each of my partners, I insisted we used at least two types of protection — mostly pills and condoms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once, I even took a Plan B even after using the pill and a condom CORRECTLY. If my period was even a day late or came later in the day than it should, I would be sent into debilitating anxiety attacks. I can't even tell you how much money I've wasted on pregnancy tests just for my period to show up 30 minutes after I had taken it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't even talk to my mother about my period because if I ever mention my boobs hurt or I'm cramping, she immediately goes, \"Are you pregnant? That's a sign of pregnancy.\" Which, even if I haven't had sex, reminds me that you can spot while pregnant and oh my god what if she's right? \n",

      "I hated taking birth control pills. I gained weight, I sank into deep, deep depressions. I would cry daily and panic if I was even one minute off taking it at the scheduled time, imagining little sperm somehow waiting to crawl into my vagina to impregnate me (yeah, sex education wasn't great here). \n",
      "\n",
      "It's here that I should mention that in my town, all major healthcare systems are religiously affiliated — and mostly run by old white men. I grew up being told there two types of birth control: pills, which I hated, and good-old-fashioned abstinence. Not the most appealing of choices, really, because as I grew up, I finally felt comfortable with my sex drive. \n",

      "I got off the pill and only used condoms with my fiancé. We used them correctly, I would panic around my period, but once it came I was good until the next cycle (still not a great coping mechanism but hey, whatever). Everything was fine until we had two condoms break — in one month. Which meant two rounds of Plan B — and a period delayed by over two weeks.\n",

      "I'm sorry, a what? It's 99% effective? I don't have to worry about it for five years? It won't affect my ovaries, keeping my hormones in check and normal? Weight gain is minimal, depression is rarely a side effect?\n",

But, I have an internship starting in mid September (I can’t take off until December) and I’m struggling to find a place that will be able to do it on time because they have to order the IUD (I’ve spent hours calling places in my area).

I later found out a week ago while randomly googling that the medicine causes an interaction.

I also can't have more than two or three alcoholic beverages without getting sick later in the night, and I've learned only fairly recently that birth control pills could be related to this.

Back in April I started spotting for 16 days straight before finally being put on birth control pills (Lo Loestrin Fe) and god dammit I felt so much better. My periods were heavier but were shorter and I never had any irregular breakthrough bleeding and my skin cleared up, it was great! \n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I got off the 3 month period of using BCPs I started spotting a week after the initial pill breakthrough bleed. It lasted a week, thought it would stop from then on but then lo and behold, 6 days after being spotting-free I started spotting and heavily bleeding 🙃 It’s like adjustment period but without the acne and mood swings. \n",

The copper IUD seems like an option but I don’t want to experience the same side effects that nexplanon gave me, like the irregular bleeding. So mirena seems like it’d be a good option because of the chance that I won’t have periods at all. Although I’m open to getting the copper IUD if anyone has any opinions/experiences of the two different IUD options. \n",

I’m worried this is going to be another “one size fits all” sort of thing and I’ll have a horrible experience. I’ve had a colposcopy done before though and that wasn’t bad at all since I took two Aleve before going in. I don’t know if its at all similar to that. \n",

      "A nurse from my OBGYN ___OFFICE___ told me once I get nexplanon removed tomorrow I will likely be on birth control pills for a month and when I start my breakthrough bleed they’ll try to insert an IUD soon afterwards because I guess the cervix softens then so it wont hurt as much.

My libido plummeted, so much so that anything sexual- or just seeing my husband naked- was repulsive and nauseating. While I had a very high libido before nexplanon, I was not sexual active before being married, so this wasn't a major concern for me. My husband on the other hand was, respectfully, very concerned.\n",

      "I didn't believe it was birth control for the longest time, because it was such a slow change. It took 6 months to stop spotting and after the 1 year mark, no libido. So....after many therapy visits, my doctor had said that my libido loss was likely from birth control, and any trauma I've experienced in my childhood doesn't seem like it would affect my love life now. My previous experiences had been incredibly unpleasant before, with an older male doctor not listening to my pain and screaming \"stop\" as he's putting the speculum in me. I waited about 9 months to make the change. We were planning on moving to a big city, and there was so many other options for better doctors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I find a great doctors ___OFFICE___, and decide to make the move. They decide on Kyleena for me as the best fit. We remove the nexplanon, easy. I took 600 mg ibuprofen, 10 mg valium, and was given Percocet as well (I ended up not needing it). It was incredibly painful all around. They were so patient with everything. Enter speculum, wait for the pain to subside, open the speculum, wait for the pain. Swab. Then they let my husband in the room to help keep me calm. Then they measured and inserted without any pause. I'm glad they did, it was such sharp pain, and in a place I've never felt pain! Much worse than any pain I've ever had from cramping, and I'm used to heaving and fainting from painful cramps when not on any hormone therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the insertion, I've had spotting and dull cramping. I expect it to be a similar journey to nexplanon, giving it upwards of 6 months. Thanks to another user here, I immediately began taking probiotics that could help some of my libido/sex life issues. About 2 weeks in, I was nervous because I hadn't felt any changes to my libido/mood. Then suddenly aroind the 3 week mark, a switch flipped. No foreplay needed, no pain, no dryness, it was incredible for only having failed attempts at sex before (too painful even with loads of lube because I was just uninterested). I feel back to my horny teenage self, and I love it! It's almost too much for the husband to handle, but neither of us are complaining. Now,  I just had my follow up and when inserting the speculum, there was no pain whatsoever, no anxiety, nothing.\n",

Starting about a week ago from today (so about 1.5 weeks from insertion), I’ve had the urge to pee frequently, which I never usually do. I actually have had joking sessions with my husband, who drinks a LOT of water and pees a lot, that my bladder must be abnormally large because I don’t pee super often, despite drinking water throughout the day. Now I have to pee several times a day. It’s been about 1-2 times an hour over the last couple of days, which I know isn’t *that* often, but it is something new. I constantly feel the slight pressure in my bladder like I have to pee, even if I just went and haven’t had anything to drink since my last trip to the bathroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "These symptoms concerned me and I did a round of googling and everything online stated “UTI”. As mentioned above, I’ve never had one before so I just assumed that’s what I must have. I made an appointment with the ob/gyn that put in my new IUD and gave a urine sample. The sample was tested by two separate labs and came back negative for any infection. I expressed concern over the IUD causing issues and the nurse practitioner did a full pelvic exam and she told me that everything looked/felt normal. She didn’t seem concerned and left me by saying “if things get worse or don’t get better after a while, we can refer you to a urologist” and that was that. \n",

I know the symptoms for that can vary from very mild (like mine) to pretty severe, with pelvic pain, etc. I’m not sure if I have IC or not, but I can’t help but feel like it has something to do with my IUD. I’ve read that even if your doctor can see the strings, your IUD may still be placed incorrectly, which can cause inflammation of the pelvic region, including the bladder. I know that an ultrasound is the only way to confirm an IUD’s placement, so maybe I’ll schedule one soon if my symptoms continue. \n",

I also had some light spotting after intercourse, and some mood changes and changes in appetite. I called my Dr.’s ___OFFICE___ &amp; they told me i should come in just to get my IUD checked. When i went, they looked inside my vagina to feel for it strings &amp; said they felt out of place and scheduled an ultrasound. I had two ultrasounds. One vaginally and one through my belly/uterus area. The Dr. said that my IUD was out of place in my uterus. This caused my uterine lining to be slightly too thin for their liking (but still safe), and the cramping. They scheduled an appointment to have it taken out. \n",

Like i said before, getting one in is pretty painful. I’m a pretty nervous person in general and my anxiety was through the roof. I went to my appointment extremely nervous and voiced my anxiousness to my Dr. She was super sweet and said it may hurt more because I was getting so worked up in my head. I tried to relax and chill through out the process, and it honestly went better than expected. It didn’t hurt as bad as i hyped it up to be in my head, but it still was uncomfortable. Again, just felt like some pretty bad period cramps. It was over in less than 10 minutes! I didn’t get light headed at all this time &amp; quickly got dressed. On the drive home I was cramping badly, so I rested for the remainder of the day and toke some ibuprofen. Since then, i’ve had some off and on bleeding like a light period. Everything seems back to normal and i’m happy i decided to go through with a second IUD! Don’t be super nervous if you are getting one inserted! It’s not as bad as you think.\n",

I had enough savings for 6 months but definitely not enough for medical bills or to pay my full insurance without my work's compensations.) So then from the end of January to End of February I worked on getting my new job in place and started early March. Lucky for me, my insurance with my job now did not have a waiting period and could use it from the day I started.

      "\n",
      "Only in the end of May did I end up making an appointment during the first few days in June to see my GP because I was having pain urinating and cramping even off my periods. GP treated me for UTI and yeast infection after doing full pap and STD testing (nothing had changed since the last time I got tested but GP still insisted I get it done.) GP asked if I wanted to follow up with Gyno for ultra sound still and IUD, as well as gyno would be able to advise more on if I had anything else going on there. \n",

NP advised she felt that my painful periods were likely from the formation of these larger cysts and that they form and resolve causing the pain. Scheduled me six weeks out for ultrasound to make sure the cyst resolved. And said that as long as the second ultra sound looked okay and the cyst was indeed gone, then she would just put in the order for my IUD since I'd had the consult prior and just had all the testing redone. (NP did another pap at appointment and said that I did not have yeast infection but still had BV. Honestly I don't know what to think but an $80 cream later everything is fine down there.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now. End of July I had my second ultra sound, and got results back last week over the phone via voicemail that the cyst had resolved and I didn't need any follow up. Yay! I can finally stop worrying about late periods and possible pregnancy! Right? Right??\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I’m sure you can guess where this is going—oh yes, when I called in to make my IUD appointment I was told that the NP did not put in the order for it. That I will need another appointment to to have an IUD consultation, to go over my ultrasound results in detail (then why was I told last week that my results were fine and would need no follow up?), to get retested for STDs (you literally did this a two months ago and nothing has changed??), and I will need some other tests that the nurse did not specify. \n",

      "Aaaaand so at this point I get to wait another three weeks for that appointment which will most likely leave me at least a month out from an appointment for and IUD IF I get approval. IF. (I don’t have high hopes right now.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I'm just so exhausted from this experience I just don’t understand why getting practical birth control can be difficult and expensive?  This doesn’t feel like anything other than ringing more money out of me at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you’ve been counting, that’s five appointments, two ultrasounds (which cost over $400 each after insurance adjustments btw), and an ungodly amount of tests that I don't even want to count and this point. Oh. And still at least two more appointments and some tests to come. \n",

      "One month ago, I (20, F) had my Paragard inserted. I was absolutely terrified. I had never been on the pill, or any other form of birth control before. I’ve only used condoms until this. Upon doing my own research to prepare myself, most of what I could find were horror stories. Let me be the one to tell you that it’s not all bad. A couple of hours before my appointment, I took 800 mg of ibuprofen. My gynecologist walked me through the process, explained when the cramps would begin, and showed me the IUD. First, they inserted a speculum to open my vaginal canal. This was my first time even having a pelvic exam done. The speculum didn’t hurt, and it wasn’t cold like some people say it is. It wasn’t that uncomfortable. I would compare it to putting in a tampon, except there’s a bit more pressure once it’s expanded. Then, he sterilized my cervical area, which didn’t hurt. He explained to me that I would experience three series of cramps. The first was as he entered the sound (a skinny stick is the best way to describe it) through my cervix and into my uterus to align the opening properly. Then, he fully inserted the sound to measure my uterus. Then, he inserted the IUD. During each of these processes, there were cramps. I’ll be honest, it didn’t feel good at all. It was different than normal period cramps. They were sharper, and more concentrated around my cervix and uterus, which makes sense. However, the process wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I have a low pain tolerance, and I half-expected to faint. However, I wasn’t even dizzy after it was over. The entire process took maybe 10 minutes. It passed by so quickly. After the IUD was inserted, the sharp cramps stopped, and I was only left with “normal” cramps, similar to those during a period. My body just needed time to adjust. After I left the gynecologist’s ___OFFICE___, I was cramping pretty bad for a few hours. The next day, I was cramping a little bit still, but it wasn’t as bad. I did have some spotting and bloody discharge soon after, but it seemed like it was mostly old period blood that was just being pushed out by the cramps. This is normal. It’s been one month, and I’ve experienced light cramping and spotting occasionally, but nothing to be concerned about. My first period with the IUD was not as bad as I thought it would be. I knew that periods after the copper IUD would be heavier and the cramps may be worse. The first day, I was cramping pretty bad, but it wasn’t anything I hadn’t experienced before. I’ve been cramping off and on still, and I’m on day 5 of my period currently. The bleeding has been heavier, but I can tell it’s lightening up now. My periods usually last 5-7 days, but I think it may be a little longer this time. All in all, I am very pleased with my experience with the Paragard IUD so far. 10 years of protection without even having to think about it. If you’re trying to prepare yourself or thinking of getting the Paragard, you will find horror stories. I hope my experience helps someone realize that the scary stuff is a lot less likely. Of course people will post about their bad experiences more than others would post about their good ones. Personally, it’s been a wonderful experience.\n",

So last Thursday I had the kyleena inserted, the insertion was as I expected, but afterwards for about 5 hours I had the worst cramps of my entire life. I thought I was going to faint, I was sweating and shaking and definitely worried, but the worst seemed to have subsided. It has been almost a week and I am still experiencing mild cramping for most of the day, and have a feeling of discomfort all the time, but not enough yet for me to go to the doctor. I also have a bit of discharge, my vaginal odour smells different than it used to, and I tried to check and see if the strings were there but I couldn't feel them. I called my doctor's ___OFFICE___ yesterday and explained that I was still experiencing cramping everyday for most of the day, and they said that, that is normal for the first two weeks but this definitely doesn't feel normal....\n",

I know the insertion hurts, but it’s quick so I’m not worried about it. If I get it can I not have rough sex anymore? I have a very shallow cervix so my brain is telling me it’s a bad idea.

      "\n",
      "It's recommended to get an IUD inserted **during your period**, though it is possible to have it when you're not on your period. It's less painful if it's during your period since your cervix is already open and softer. If you DO choose to get an IUD during your period, **call the OBGYN ___OFFICE___ the first day you get your period** because often times you won't be able to get an appointment the day you call and depending on the length of your period, you don't want to miss this opportunity. I got mine towards the end of my period, which was not a problem according to the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went in and they took a urine test. They confirm that you're not pregnant (and whatever else they find through the urine test). Then checked my normal vitals and weight. I was then taken back to the room where they asked me to sign a paper saying I was agreeing to getting LILETTA. The reason why I picked LILETTA over other IUD options was because 1. it's the most affordable (even with insurance) (and if you don't have insurance, they're really intentional about making sure it's as affordable as possible for girls/women. Check their website for more information), 2) for every IUD that is paid for, they give an IUD to a girl/women in need in underserved countries/communities for free and 3) the IUD is good for up to 6 years. Mirena is practically identical; the only difference is the price, the longevity of the IUD (different by 1-2 years), and the way the IUD itself looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The insertion process wasn't painful. It was **uncomfortable**. It helps to close your eyes and maintain slow breathing and make sure you're relaxing your bottom half of your body. I found myself clinching my butt and it just felt more comfortable when I would relax everything down there. The process was about 10 minutes. She first inserts a clamp, stabilizes it, then cleans the cervix. She inserts the IUD and let me feel what the strings would feel like. She inserted the IUD then cut the strings. She then told me it was inserted but then inserted two long q-tip things, which kind of felt like a tampon going in. She told me it was over, to put my shorts back on, and gave me a pad since I was expected to have some light bleeding. She gave me a little pamphlet that briefly went over commonly asked questions, but besides that they didn't give me strict guidelines. She said I could go showering normally and could go on with my daily schedule. The assistant that came in to help her said she has it and everyone else in the ___OFFICE___ who has it says they LOVE it and swear by it. She hasn't had bleeding since she got hers inserted, which was really comforting to hear! Once it was over and I got up, I felt period cramps and just feeling like my whole stomach was super heavy and bloaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to the front desk to schedule my 1 month check-up appointment. I slowly began to feel really dizzy, weak, and my vision started going black. I told them I was going to faint so I sat down. I started sweating and got really hot. Then I quickly got really cold and put my jacket back on. I sat in the waiting room for a few more minutes, closed my eyes, drank water, and tried to control my breathing... all while the cramps were getting pretty worse and constant. \n",

      "Since then, I've been in bed with a heating pad. I didn't take any ibuprofen or Tylenol because I'm stubborn and don't like taking medicine. I like riding through the pain. I ate some Matzo crackers (very similar to Saltine crackers but Gluten free and Vegan!) that my neighbor gave me and am feeling a lot better. The worst part about all of this was the nausea afterwards and the current cramps. I haven't been bleeding, but I'm expected to have some light bleeding everyday for the next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add more background information, I'm 24, extremely active, vegetarian, and was sexually active (partner and I recently broke up so I don't see myself having sex anytime soon), and masterbate regularly. I don't get cramps during my regular periods. My periods last around 4-5 days and are on the lighter side! I know all of our bodies are different and react differently, but sometimes it helps to read someone who is similar to you so I thought I'd add in this detail!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll keep updating here how I feel over time. Overall, I'm really glad I got the IUD. The doctor did say if I decide to be sexually active between now and the next check up (one month from the day I got the IUD inserted), to use an additional form of birth control because sometimes the IUD will move around or will slip out and until the doctor checks a month after getting it inserted, it's better to be safe!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Payment**: Liletta is about $900-$1000 without insurance. With insurance, you shouldn't have to pay for anything as long as your OBGYN marks it off as preventative care and sends that to your insurance. If you happen to move to a different state or place AFTER getting your IUD inserted, you can have a physician or a OBGYN remove the IUD at no cost. When you pay for the IUD, you're paying for the insertion - not anything else. If your insurance runs out while you have an IUD in, it won't affect payments for the IUD as long as the payment was processed through your insurance while you were still covered. In other words, I got my IUD in September, but my insurance ends in December (thanks Covid.....), but I won't have to worry about paying for anything as long as the insurance covers my IUD before December.\n",

(She said Mirena tends to trigger hormonal acne more than Kyleena due to the higher hormones) I opted out of the Copper IUD since my periods were already light and I had minimal cramping so I didn't want to worsen that.

      "\n",

It felt like a sharp pinch (pain level 4-5?) and it lasted for three seconds. She then deployed the IUD into my uterus which then I felt the pinch move from the right side to all sides of my lower abdomen. Felt like a lingering, numb cramp all around my uterus which was like pain level 3 or 4. I could feel on the whole part of my uterus seconds after but it became nearly painless, quickly went away. She didn't give me any warning before deployment so I actually didn't even know she did it until she said: \"All done!\".  After she took at the inserter/sound it was painless. She went ahead and cut the strings which I did not even feel but I could hear. I felt an uncomfortable sensation all around my uterus area but it was bearable.  \n",

      "I’ve never been so nervous in my life for this insertion.  For background it was recommended to me for medical reasons and not for birth control reasons.  I am currently at zero risk for pregnancy however I have been having increasingly painful periods.   I got my period a bit later in life than my friends I was 15 when it started and it was hell on earth from day one.  Extremely painful cramps to the point where I would break out into cold sweats turn deathly pale and vomiting.  It was absolutely terrible and an awful experience.  I complained to doctors about it and to my family.  My doctors recommended birth control to help manage the pain and symptoms but as a minor my mother refused to get me the pills. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m ashamed to say it took me years after becoming a legal adult to bring this back up to a doctor again as I had just gotten used to living with the pain and heavy flow and clotting.  I thought I was just unlucky. I had my first Pap smear in 2016 which went sideways oh so fast.  The highlights were I was a virgin and the doctor couldn’t get the speculum in.  I don’t believe she legitimately believed me when I told her I was a virgin and basically she shoved the larger speculum in and caused quite a bit of bleeding for days.  The pain also ended up with me passing out in the room and getting a concussion.  To put it mildly I was absolutely terrified of ever putting myself in that situation again.  \n",
      "Last year I had finally had enough and worked myself up to seeing a gynecologist again (brand new one obviously).  She recommended me starting on pills and that we’d do the super low dose ones.  I started taking them and overall my periods greatly improved.  Way less pain and bleeding.  Where I could fill an ultra tampon in about 2 hours I was able to get to super tampons in about 4 hours.  Drastic improvement overall. Some moodiness but nothing terrible.  This year I went back because pain was coming back and concentrated on a certain sides.  I went for ultrasounds and still have an MRI scheduled but the ultrasound showed some growths outside of where my uterine lining is supposed to be growing or possibly fibroids.  The gynecologist basically told me my best option and treatment was an iud to manage pain.  \n",
      "I have explained my past trauma and tbh haven’t had a Pap smear since the last terrible one because of fear.  I asked if while we do this if she can go ahead and just do the Pap as well.  She was absolutely amazing.  She honestly scheduled the appointment for me within a week so I couldn’t work myself up to much over it.  She also double booked herself to make it more convenient for me.  \n",
      "Day of the procedure I’m legitimately freaking out but I had done research and saw to take pain medication about an hour before.  I have prescription naproxen because of my period pain so took one of those an hour before.  I went to the ___OFFICE___ and I’m not going to lie I’m terrified and barely slept the last few days.  There has been crying and shaking from nerves alone.  Then I’m in the room and waiting and let me tell you anxiety is awful.  No one was there but just waiting for the doctor was stressing me out.  Finally she comes in and starts the procedure.  She was absolutely amazing.  Kept guiding me through what needed to be done. Told me what I had to do, when to take a deep breath, when to cough for the placement.  Warned me before which things she was doing would cause me pain etc.   It wasn’t terrible but my anxiety and the stress of it did have me crying on the table. End of the day I was able to get the procedure and go back to work immediately after.  \n",
      "Minor cramping has been going on since it’s been placed and seems to get worse as the day goes on like later at night it seems to spike for some reason.   \n",
      "Recommendations: if you have someone who you’re comfortable with absolutely ask them to go with you.  I unfortunately really don’t have anyone who could have gone. My family is against birth control and hormones and my age group all has full time jobs so it would have required someone taking the day off and I wasn’t willing to ask that as I didn’t take the day off.  Also highly recommend only having a gynecologist place it, it may just be my past bad experience with a non specialist doing the Pap but it was a completely different and better experience.  Also make sure you have a heating pad.  I like the electric as it stays hot the entire time.\n",

      "Late January this year I decided I'd like to get a copper IUD. It took this long to get it because my doc insisted that my vaginal and cervical swabs need to be negative. I've yet to hear that this is something OBGYNs insist on when placing an IUD in other countries, but I guess in Bosnia it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had to take several rounds of antibiotics for 2 infections and also get rid of a nasty yeast infection in between. The whole Covid-19 situation didn't make it easier to get all of it done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though my doc was awesome, I had to get the swabs done in another medical institution, where I was asked why th I would want an IUD since I haven't had children yet. (maybe because I'd like to keep it that way?)\n",
      "\n",
      "TODAY:\n",
      "Fast forward to today, where I went to my doc, expecting her to postpone the IUD placement, because of an irritation on my vulva. After examining me, she decided it'd be alright to place it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I had lost all hope of getting it placed today, I didn't take any painkillers. She also dilated my cervix manually. It hurt like some of my worst period cramps, but she waited for me to be able to relax again before she continued. The IUD itself didn't hurt. The procedure lasted around 5 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt dizzy as soon as she was done. I live 20 meters from the doctor's ___OFFICE___, but I almost passed out in the elevator. Took Ibuprofen 600mg because it still hurt like some of my worst periods. Instantly got diarrhea from the pain and also threw up some 20 minutes later. When the painkiller kicked in, I was good to go and have been since then. The only thing I feel is that my lower abdomen is a tiny bit tense, but that also might just be me being overly conscious of the IUD.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bled a bit at the doctor's ___OFFICE___, but only spotted afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of now, I feel fine and haven't had any complaints for the last 9 hours or so, since I got home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will update on any major changes.\n",

      "I have never had kids and I don’t know if I want them so I went to a brand new doctor today to have my IUD inserted. Long story short about the need for a new doctor was that my insurance was giving me a hard time getting the IUD and my old doctors ___OFFICE___ didn’t want to help me navigate the process. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I asked the doctor for 1 mg Ativan and I took 800 mg ibuprofen prior to the insertion. I didn’t eat. I went in, got weighed and asked to provide urine for a pregnancy test. Then the doctor came in and described the process. She told me that if the dilation was too painful, she would send me home with a prescription for the cervix dilation medication. She started with a transvaginal ultrasound and told me my uterus was retroverted but that doesn’t change anything but the angle she approaches the IUD insertion. \n",
      "\n",
      "She then put in the speculum and then the discomfort began. The pinch when they pull your cervix into alignment is not fun. She was quick however and moved to put the dilator in. She told me I was completely in charge and if we needed to stop just to let her know. She then push the dilator in for the uterus depth measurement. It was very uncomfortable. I audibly said ow, which is something I never do. Then, she pulled the depth probe back out and went to set up the IUD for insertion. The pain was gone and there was only very mild cramping. She told me to take a break and then we had only 30 seconds left of discomfort. \n",
      "\n",
      "She lied. It was more like ten seconds and it wasn’t very painful at all. She pulled the tube out and I felt nothing but very minor cramping. I sat right up after she took out the speculum  and she finished a second transvaginal ultrasound to ensure proper placement. Then she said 5-8 weeks to confirm placement but you are good to go. \n",
      "\n",
      "I walked to the front desk, after putting on my pants of course, and only felt a slight twinge on the lower right side of my uterus. Otherwise, some minor cramping and that’s it. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: The dilation/measurement was a 6/10 but overwhelming because I felt stuck. It was quick, thankfully. The insertion itself was almost painless. The transvaginal ultrasound very painless. Overall, would do it again if I had too.\n",

The topical lidocaine is to be applied around the outside of the vagina and a little bit of the way in, and it does have mucosal absorption, but my doctor didn't mention anything about interactions, kind of just... gave me the prescription. They're out of the ___OFFICE___ for a bit and I won't be able to get in touch with them. Does anyone know if the vaginal lidocaine can decrease the efficacy of my birth control?

      "I'm here to shed some light on the ins and out for Kyleena and give my feedback on how it went for me!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a 24F on BC, but I was terrible on remembering to take it so I decided to try something that has a higher success rate of preventing contraception. IUDs in general have the highest success rate of preventing contraception, not including abstinence. \n",
      "\n",
      "My insurance was going to cover it in full, so I decided to at least give it a shot. Plus the success rate was a major selling point for me. I had been on BC for over 6+ years at this point. I went on reddit and other sites to gauge how people felt about it in general. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\[Insertion #1\\] One of the biggest things with an IUD is that it can (or should only) only be inserted into your uterus during your period. There's lots of online images you can look up that show exactly how Kyleena gets inserted. Some OBGYNs may not require you to be on your period, HOWEVER, it's going to hurt like crazy if you want to get it inserted too close to the end of your cycle, or not on your cycle at all. I was towards the end of my period during the first insertion.\n",
      "\n",
      " I was super nervous about the whole process before hand. The OBGYN told me to take 4 ibuprofen hour prior to the procedure. That;s about 800 mg total. You should always ask your doctor what you should take beforehand for the pain. I should mention that the doctor I had was very curt and not reassuring at all. her bedside manner was quite lacking. She began the insertion process and it was by far the most pain I've endured down there. It felt like a sharp knife slicing me. She then realized that it wasn't going in. She tried again and it finally went in. It was so painful I felt like passing out. Afterwards, I got an ultrasound at the same ___OFFICE___ to make sure it was positioned well, which it was. Felt no pain afterwards and little to no bleeding. BF took me to get ice-cream right after.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[Post-Insertion #1\\] About a month after the insertion, my period rolled around. Intense cramping, but nothing crazy or extreme. I use a menstrual cup as I find it much more convenient. Around the 3rd day of my period I had a hard time getting the cup out to clean it. Felt huge, intense cramps afterwards. When I went home to change my cup again, lo and behold, was my IUD floating around in my menstrual cup. YUP. I panicked greatly and started freaking out. I didn't feel any pain at that point but I called my OBGYN and set-up a re-insertion appointment 2 days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[Insertion #2\\] This time around, I had a very nice lady who was very reassuring. I asked her if the menstrual cup could cause tugging, which is why the IUD fell out. She didn't have a really good answer for me. However, when she went in to re-insert Kyleena, I felt almost no pain, just a slight cramp. It was infinitely better than my first insertion. Got another ultrasound and was out in no time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: I decided to forgo tampons or menstrual cups for the first 3 months of having Kyleena. IUD expulsion is very rare, but once it happens, it could happen again. I decided not to risk it with the menstrual cup for the first couple of months. My period cramps are not too bad, and my period flow is regular. The first IUD insertion had me questioning my sanity and life choices, but the second time around was much better. The heavier your period flow, the easier the insertion as the uterus opens up wider during that time. Most likely what happened with me. No significant acne flare-ups, but I've been on Spironolactone to help combat my hormonal acne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips for those considering Kyleena:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Ask your doctor if you can take any pain meds beforehand and how many mg.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Make sure you get the insertion during a heavy period day, otherwise it will hurt massively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Go to the Kyleena website's FAQ section, it has a lot of helpful info and diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Be aware that expulsion could happen, though it is very, very rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask away any questions you have! This is my 3rd or 4th month after the 2nd insertion.\n",

Heres my issue, I don't wanna be on BC for a few reasons. 1) I'm HORRIBLE at taking/remembering to take medicine, I won't take Tylenol let alone allergy medicine unless I absolutely have to. I choked on a lot of stuff as a kid so I developed a reflex that makes it hard to force swallow medicine...2) every female in my family that has had nexplanon has gone batshit crazy, one of my sisters dug it out of her arm with a knife cause her doctor wouldn't take it out...then the IUD implant freaks me out for some reason, idk why. 3)I have very irregular cycles, I can go 80+ days between periods and when I do get my period its very light, lasting maybe 3-4 days at the very most. I don't get mood swings, cramping, or any negative side affects. My periods have ALWAYS been like this since I first started getting them at around 12/13 years old.

Secondly, my SO isn't the biggest fan on condoms and we have a good sex drive/attractions to each other, granted I know he will if I ask him too. I just don't know what to do, I know BC would make things easier but I really really don't wanna be on it. Does anyone know of any non hormonal BC that doesnt need to be taken everyday? or any other alternatives? I like the calendar method and its what ive always used, however every OBGYN ive been to will scuff at it and say it works but isn't as effective as typical BC is.

Normally, I take only 3 three placebos as my doctor instructs me and I was due to start a new pack last night. The night I took my first placebo, I had unprotected sex and my bf came inside me, no big deal we've done it before. Last night, upon opening the bag from the pharmacy, I saw I was given the generic brand of norethindrone, rather than the combo Nortrel pill which has norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.\n",

After my mom did some research we learned that the pill I was taking had a high level of progesterone (I believe) which is what may have been contributing to the cystic acne. Came off of it and ultimately ended up with tri-sprintec and the cystic acne went away. Ultimately years down the road my skin was amazing despite maybe every now and then when closer to my period. I hardly noticed any issues reproductive wise except a period still when on the placebo pill. \n",

      "*Note before the next part: my doctor's ___OFFICE___ has multiple practitioners and one of them is an OBGYN but she travels to multiple locations so it's hard to get in to see her. My first appointment with her was by chance. She happened to be in and available when I arrived for a walk in with whatever practitioner was available, she happened to be there and so the front desk arranged me to see her since I was in for women's health exam for a pap smear. So that's this next part:\n",
      "\n",
      "About a 9-13 months ago I go in for a pap smear. The gyno is this super eccentric lady who seems to know her shit. I still have some complaints like chin hairs, more than I feel like a 23/24 year old me should be experiencing. But this does not come up until after she reads my chart and independently makes the decision that triphasic BC isn't good because it makes you more prone to mood swings. Plus the period. She doesn't like periods she says! So she tells me she's putting me on a monophasic BC. I express to her my fears with previous experience where BC made my skin go to shit and i'm finally on one that kind of doesn't make me feel like i'm on one (but what do I know??? i'm emotional so maybe it is causing mood swings??). \"I express to her that i'm very worried and want to be sure there won't be side effects. She ensures me she'll even place a note that I need to have brand sprintec because the generics have other ingredients that can cause issues and this one will be fine and no period. Well long story as my body is still adjusting to a now continous monophasic pill the pharmacy/my insurance give me a generic pill. Annoyed but whatever. Then I don't have refills because apparently she wanted a follow up apt. But when I called to make one she was not available for a very long time. So I get a walk in with a random practitioner lady and explain the situation and she still ends up sending a different generic now to the pharmacy. Annoyed as F i say F it and take it because i don't have time to go to the doctor again. Now i'm spotting randomly. After about two or three months I'm frustrated so I make an appointment with the original gyno. She gets me back on the sprintec monophasic. However, now I have been bleeding three months straight. What the F is going on? I made a other appointment for 9/25 with the OG gyno because at this point i'm constantly wearing tampons and wasting money and am worried something else is up. I want to back on to tri-sprintec but not sure if I need to stick it out. I'd rather have a period one time per month than this constant bleeding. Also I feel like the black chin hairs have gotten worse. does anyone else have a similar experience or suggestion?????\n",

      "\n",
      "Several years ago my period would not stop. It lasted about 15 months. It was very very heavy, with clots ranging from the size of a dime to the size of a golf ball. I'm a pretty private person so I always just kept it under wraps and never told anyone. I was at my little brothers birthday party and I started feeling really weird, then I started vomiting and I turned very pale. The next day my mother took me to the ER because I had been having this numb feeling in the right side of my face. They did all the basic ER stuff and then took some blood. They all rushed back into my room saying my blood level was a 6 and basically demanding to know where the hell all my blood had went. This is where I had to come clean about what had been going on with my period for so long. Later that night I was visited by a GYNO and he wanted to do an ultrasound just to make sure I nothing was seriously wrong, there wasn't. So I got 3 units of blood and left from the hospital. Few days later I was still bleeding so I made an appointment with the same GYNO and went in. He did an exam on me and told me he didn't see anything wrong and that he could say it was because the lining of my uterus was so thick, but in my case that wasn't the culprit. He actually went as far as to say my lining is a bit thinner than normal. He prescribed me BC pills. He told me as soon as I got them filled at the pharmacy to take 5, then 4, so on until I got to one then one a day. It worked, for the first time in a year and a half I was no longer bleeding. Until I made it to the placebo pills. When it came time to take those the bleeding came back and once again would not stop. I had taken about half of my pack and the bleeding just wouldn't go away. I couldn't go back to see him again because I didn't have the money for an ___OFFICE___ appointment ($250). So I went to the local county health department. They refused to give me the BC. instead they put me on the depo shot. It worked wonderfully after about 6 months. I had no bleeding whatsoever and finally felt like I could live a normal life! Until...earlier this year. I went in and got my shot and a couple days later the bleeding was back. I bleed for 3 months continuously, passing huge clots, and no end in sight. I went back in early July of this month and had an exam, and talked to them about what I could do. They suggested the POP pills and the nice GYNO suggested I take a round of doxycycline which had worked for helping to stop bleeding in some of her other patients. The POP pills made the bleeding stop up until last week when I started bleeding again (no clots thankfully) and it's been a bit heavy but nowhere near what I consider my \"heavy\" I've been on POP for almost 3 months now (new appointment the 24th of this month) so I guess my question is will this \"breakthrough bleeding\" eventually end or do I need to go back on the depo shot? I'm so confused and I honestly just want it to stop. I'm starting a new job later this month and it's a very physically demanding job and the constant bleeding makes it hard for me to do pretty much anything. Any and all advice/input will be greatly appreciated!!\n",

      "Honestly, I felt really lonely and isolated. I wished there was someone to support me emotionally. Texting and calling my mom and my SO afterwards helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yeah, it hurt pretty BAD. I wouldn’t call it the worst pain I’ve ever experienced, but it definitely was a really bizarre kind of pain. VERY uncomfortable. But still bearable. \n",
      "\n",
      "NOW BY THE END OF IT THOUGH. Wow. The dizziness, the lightheadedness(?). I swear my left ear stopped hearing for a hot minute lol it felt very much like that one time I had a heat stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "After they were done, the nurse was like “OK dress up and we’re going to talk to you in the previous room”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t think I would pass out but I could absolutely feel it coming, so I took my time before standing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried putting on my clothes but I still felt so dizzy, I had to sit on the floor just to catch my breath. I don’t know how much time passed, but after I put my clothes on and tried walking, I lost my vision and I’m pretty sure I collapsed and I guess a nurse caught me and helped me with my way to the couch so I could sit down. \n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t talk at this point, I was just heavy breathing, although I could hear what they were saying, and apparently they checked my blood pressure, and it was pretty low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short they let me rest in a room with a bed for like 10 minutes, crazy crazy cramping kicked in after I came back to my senses, the doctor said to come check on the IUD in a month and I was sent home!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fun fact, I didn’t know that my insurance was covering the IUD so when I learned I got it for free, the cramping disappeared 🤣 would have been 37000¥ (apprx 350$)\n",
      "\n",
      "That was my personal experience:) I think the amount of ice cream I ate after getting home and the elimination of the risk of pregnancy should make up for all the pain I went through lol \n",
      "But that just me:)\n",

      "I went to my gynecologist’s ___OFFICE___ a couple months ago and wanted a different option other than the pill (I can’t remember to take it at all). When I first asked she told me no that they don’t do that for anyone who is still a virgin. Decided to let it go then and continued on the pill. \n",
      "Well I had another appointment and I mentioned to her that I was getting married in two months and wonder if she would consider giving me the IUD once I begun having sex. She once again told me no, that no one newly having sex had any business with an IUD and told me to try nexplanon even though most women hate it. Is this normal? Do you have to regularly be having sex for a long time before you’re eligible for an IUD?\n",

      "\n",
      "The monogamous relationship which made the IUD seem like a good idea ended abruptly a week after the initial appointment. That combined with some heavy family stuff lead me to put my health in general, as well as my reproductive health on the back burner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now after a two year dry spell, this IUD might actually serve its purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "However now I'm worried that maybe everything isn't hunky-dory with my IUD. \n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't expel, but other than that could there be something else up with it (bad position or shifted?) that would make it less effective? \n",
      "\n",
      "The strings *feel* like they are the same length, but its hard to say for sure, since they have felt shorter when more curled, and longer when they decide to be straight randomly. I remember the length that they should be from the 1st appointment (4cm), because I specifically requested they be left longer to curl easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'm not sure what to do or even if an appointment is warranted (given the pandemic and all). I feel embarrassed for not making a timely checkup appointment and I don't even know how I would explain it to the Dr's ___OFFICE___.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR \n",
      "\n",
      "Got an IUD two years ago. Shit happened and I never made a follow up. If everything *seems* fine am I good to go or should I bite the bullet and make a really late check up appointment?\n",
