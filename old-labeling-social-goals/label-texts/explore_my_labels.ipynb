      "===========================================\nDISCOURSE\n===========================================\n\nHoly fucking smokes. Now I appreciate the doctor who dangled the old IUD that she removed before my eyes way more.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI would think because it sounds like she‚Äôs already made up her mind about keeping the babies- so it‚Äôs kind of like someone asking ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù to someone to has made up their mind about an abortion. \n\nHowever, I completely agree with this post and agree that these are all extremely valid points. Everyone jumps to congratulate someone being pregnant even though it is very likely not a great situation. I just hope OP has a support system.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDo you say that to patients who ask questions that have been asked millions of times too?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHaha yeah, that's the point you switched to once your statement that \"perfect use for pills is not 99.7% effective\" was proven wrong. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nMen‚Äôs problems (including pain) are always treated more attentively than women‚Äôs problems (even by female doctors).\n\nUGH, indeed. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHappy to help!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIs this satire?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSure, no problem. My misunderstanding. Could I get a clarification about whether it‚Äôs okay to tell other users that they‚Äôre ‚Äúgoing to get pregnant‚Äù based on their chosen method?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI love it till that happened üò≠\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAmen to that! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThank you again!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nGlad to hear your experience has been so positive. Appreciate your reply so much! Hope you‚Äôre doing well! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHaha yeah me too! üòÇ \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis is not true, pap smear do show a false positive result a lot of the time, especially in young women.\nAnd please do not tell young women who are apprehensive about having their gentials prayed open and fingered by a stranger to seek therapy because clearly they are mentally ill if they have a problem with that. Plenty of women chose not to get pap smears becuase they're invasive and painful and there is nothing mentally wrong with them.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; I don't think that a teenager knows her body enough to check the strings, to feel the cervix or to know if the IUD is in the right position.\n\nThat is assuming that most people even check the strings. If a teenager is mature enough to engage in a sexual relationship, they're also mature enough to stick a finger up and check the strings. It's really not rocket science. My point wasn't that all teenagers should get IUDs, but that it's not important to have children before getting IUDs, and that *even* teenagers can get them.\n\n&gt;There were lots of posts with the IUD perforating the uterus.\n\nExcept that has nothing to do with whether the patient has children or not. Perforation occurs due to error of the gynecologist. That being said, once the \"escape hatch\" heals up, one is free to have children. It does not lead to infertility.\n\nI understand that it's not for *you*, but you presented it as almost a general thing, and that may scare other people from getting it too.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI've never heard a good urgent care story. I'm honestly starting to think that the doctors who can't get jobs anywhere else just go to urgent care. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI agree completely! It‚Äôs terrible how little we‚Äôre taught about this stuff. \n\nTo be fair, it would be extremely difficult to test per-encounter likelihoods - I‚Äôm not even sure how it would be practically possible to design a study like that. \n\nHowever, we do know that outside a woman‚Äôs fertile window the probability is 0% - it‚Äôs a physical impossibility, not simply unlikely. The difficulty is figuring out when the window is. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much for this info!!\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nYou have asked this question many times in a number of different subs, and gotten the same answer multiple times.\n\nFrom your posts here you seem quite immature with regards to sexual matters. You need to sit down with a healthcare professional that can discuss all of this with you. You don‚Äôt seem to be satisfied with the answers Reddit users are giving you, so you need to sit down with someone of authority you will trust.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThere is a Tedx Talk video on YouTube called \"The Surprising Link Between Women's Brians and the Birth Control Pill by Sarah E. Hill. She mentions how women are attracted to different features when they are on the pill compared to other features when they are off it. She also wrote a book called \"This is Your Brain on Birth Control\".\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI had jaydess ( which is even less hormones than kyleena) and personally I had to take it out after one year because I went from a bit anxious mostly normally functioning person to being diagnosed with MDD, GAD,  attempting suicide and going on medical leave from being a student in a professional healthcare program.\n\n As soon as I took out my IUD within 3 months I discontinued all 3 of my psychiatric medications ( I was on wellbutrin, mirtazapine and propranolol for the tension headaches my anxiety caused), taking it out made me feel like I got my life back. \n\nWhile I was so unstable I saw multiple doctors and psychiatrists and not a single one of the suspected the IUD or even paid attention to it. I highly highly recommend you ( or anyone else considering an IUD) go and **read the monograph for the product**.\n\n Just control find ( ctrl + F and search for depression). \n\n[https://www.bayer.ca/omr/online/kyleena-pm-en.pdf](https://www.bayer.ca/omr/online/kyleena-pm-en.pdf)\n\n**The notion that hormones in an IUD act only locally is not true, the monograph clearly states \"** Psychiatric Patients with a history of emotional disturbances, especially the depressive type, may be more prone to have a recurrence of depression while using KYLEENA. In cases of a serious recurrence, consideration should be given to removing KYLEENA, since the depression may be drug-related. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, this was only my experience but I just want **all patients to make an informed decision** regarding birth control and I feel as though I did not. It was wild that the monograph for the product was only given to me in a little 94pg booklet after the IUD was installed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not against birth control, I think its extremely empowering and has revolutionized our society, however as any other drug its  potential side effects in *certain populations*  should not be taken lightly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPeople go on internet to complain...\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI know what she means, I said she said most women don‚Äôt see side effects because it‚Äôs ‚Äúlocalized‚Äù. My doctor acknowledged that some women get side effects from it still. I was just saying to OP that that‚Äôs why doctors recommend it, at least in my doctors case cause of the belief that it‚Äôs less likely to react to it\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRemoved as the copper IUD can not cause depression.\n\nThat is an internet myth similar to the anti vaccines myth.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHer history doesn‚Äôt mean he lacks body autonomy, which is what you are saying.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI understand where you‚Äôre coming from but I do think this was a fair way to see if it was a real issue. If he said he could still feel it after the ‚Äútrim‚Äù then you know it‚Äôs a genuine problem that will need addressed.\n\nIf the doctor had suggested saying a new IUD was inserted after one was removed (meaning OP was not on birth control but saying she was), I would wholeheartedly agree that that deception is not a good, conscientious choice.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHaha for real! Men have it so easy. Don't feel bad about freaking me out, I have long enough to forget my fears before it happens. I sincerely hope the IUD works out for you! When birth control is causing a suckfest, I try to remember it's better than getting pregnant.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nYour post is currently pending mod approval.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/birthcontrol) if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWell, first of all, no, why would it?\n\nSecond,\n&gt;everyone knows looking young=ugly.\n\nNo. You might want to change that mindset first. Why is everyone \"hating you for looking young\"? This makes no sense. I swear, except for teenagers, nobody I know wants to look \"their age\", and looking younger has always been a compliment in my books.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint *why* they happen. The cause is there, but the reason why they happen is hard to find out. Besides, they don't happen to everyone, and the ones who encounter said side effects might actually have different reasons why they're triggered. \n\nWhy they don't change it? Because they have to go through all the hoops of FDA all over again. That's why they don't even change the warnings about antibiotics, because they need studies to back that up and the funding and participants and actually people who *want* to make the study is scarce. Besides, a lot of women will still trust a pill that has been there for a long time compared to something that just came out.\n\n Back in the day when the female pill was invented, there weren't so many hoops to jump through to approve something, and some side effects were just \"it doesn't kill you? then it's okay\". Even if stricter rules came, they can't retroactively re-test every single product on the market, birth control or not, to see if it fits - if it was approved before and they didn't get crazy complaints about it, they're not gonna change it.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n^^^ so true, whenever things go awful we want everybody and their mother to know but when things go good we just move on with our lives lol\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIt‚Äôs stories like this that makes me terrified of iuds. A friend of mine has the skyla and loves it but I‚Äôm too scared I‚Äôll be one of those people where something goes horribly wrong. I personally prefer methods that I can stop/start on my own at any time without any help. I just feel more at ease that way, though unfortunately there aren‚Äôt all that many options for that, especially if you also want a method that doesn‚Äôt alter your body chemistry (which eliminates basically all hormonal methods). So with that altogether I have like half the options and some aren‚Äôt all that great (ie nonoxynol 9 is literally evil and felt like bleach being poured into my body!). I wish there was more awareness about these options and more effort to expand and improve these methods. Some women can‚Äôt use hormones and some just don‚Äôt want them, but they‚Äôre often much easier to get than things like diaphragms \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHi, there! \n\nI approved your post as it is on topic and you seem human; *however*, your account seems to be shadowbanned. Admins (not Mods) used to shadowban humans for breaking Sitewide rules, but have since changed their policy and don't currently shadowban humans (only bots or those that act like bots), For more info or \"what to do\", check out /r/ShadowBan/\n\nBut until the Admins un shadowban you, no one can see what you post or comment. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOr when you go to toss it back with some water, but you don't feel it go down because you drank too much water and now you're paranoid for some reason.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI‚Äôm confused ... why is your roommate deciding how heavy your periods are? Are you saying Mirena helped, but your bleeding is heavier than hers? Does she naturally have normal / light periods?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe ashlyna packets are so terrible because they are literally impossible to get out!! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n22 Female USA. I really hope male birth control becomes as big and varied as female bc. If we had more options other than a vasectomy or condoms then it would help so much to alleviate the stress of having to guard against unplanned/unwanted pregnancies. I have an IUD and I always stress that I‚Äôll be in that 1% that do get pregnant with it. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhy do you need to force her to take plan b if she‚Äôs been on effective birth control for 4 years?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nYou are being very discouraging of the OP. Do not make her feel like she's crazy. It may very well be her BC and it is 100% up to her. Your comment makes it seem like bc is the only option and something is wrong with her. That isn't okay.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI'm always curious about these posts where someone sees bleeding and thinks it's evidence of pregnancy. This is *never* logical. Bleeding in pregnancy is rare. All kinds of bleeding are far more common in nonpregnant women than pregnant women. \"Implantation bleeding\" only happens in about 9% of pregnancies, and not actually around the time of implantation but around the time of expected period - so it does not actually have to do with implantation. A higher percentage than that of women have spotting around the time of their period when they are not pregnant, so it's likely that those 9% would have had bleeding then even if they were not pregnant.\n\nBasically, it seems like the lines got crossed somewhere between \"a minority of women bleed even when they are pregnant - isn't that crazy?\" (true) to \"bleeding is evidence of pregnancy\" (false). It's actually the opposite: ANY bleeding is evidence of nonpregnancy. Not definitive evidence, but evidence nonetheless.\n\nUsing the pill and condoms correctly, I did the math and it's about 80 times more likely you'll get cancer than pregnant.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n"

      "===========================================\nSEEKING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT\n===========================================\n\n[TITLE: took pill for 26 days - am i safe to start my placebo week?] \n\nHey everybody! I'll try to make to make this very short -\n\nI'm in a LDR, I recently visited my lovely partner and the last time we've had unprotected intercourse was the night of the 21st to the 22nd of July. I should've already been on my placebo week then, but didn't want to deal with my mood swings while I was with him.\n\nWill I be protected if I take my 7 days of placebo week again starting on Saturday? This might be a no-brainer, sorry, but I just wanted to make sure! After that period, I'll start a new full blister and keep the started one for backup.\n\nMany thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: nervous about starting birth control for the first time (lo loestrin fe)] \n\nI am supposed to start taking Lo Loestrin Fe today but I am really nervous about the side effects. I have never taken any birth control before so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to. I felt good about it when I left my gyno but have becoming more anxious about it since. I also made the mistake of reading all the bad reviews for this particular pill and now I am even more freaked out. \nHas anyone taken Lo Loestrin Fe? Did you have a positive or negative reaction! Should I be this worried? \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: fighting with gyno about ortho micronor (mini pill)] \n\nI will try make this short and sweet. I switched to Ortho Micronor (mini pill) due to migraines and moved to a different state. The new Gyno prescribed Gildess FE 1/20 (combination pill). When I picked it up from CVS, I knew it wasn't right and called the Gyno. His nurse said, \"it's the same and Ortho Micrnor is ONLY for those breastfeeding.\" I couldn't understand why I had been given it before. I called the previous Gyno nurse and she said, \"They're the same pill, you're okay.\" I said fine and took it. \n\nFlash forward to this week (placebo week) and I've had a migraine for the past 4 days. I called to switch back and they're making me come in person to talk about my options since they refuse to put me back on Ortho Micronor since it's \"only for breast feeding.\" \n\nCan someone please help me defend myself to him that I want to take the mini pill and not have an IUD/implant? Is OM exclusively for those breast feeding?\n\nI'm desperate to get rid of these migraines and have a gyno listen to me again. Thank you!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: going crazy thinking i‚Äôm pregnant. could it be?] \n\nSo, I‚Äôm actually sweating because I‚Äôm scared as fuck I could be pregnant.\nI took the pill after the 7 days of stop eight days ago. First pill I didn‚Äôt have water with me and couldn‚Äôt take it. It melted a bit in my mouth then I reached home and took it with water, even if it crumbled a bit paid attention to take it all and nothing remained. \n\nKept keeping it each day same hour until yesterday I felt a little bit of white discharge. Before pill I used to have ovulation but like A LOT, sometimes I had to put a pad!\nIn the last two days I had a small bit of discharge but still I‚Äôm so scared! I didn‚Äôt think much about the first pill since I paid attention to not leave any crumble in the tablet and the parts that melted were actually in my mouth so...\nNow I think I might have been very dumb to have sex anyway.\nDo you think I could be pregnant? What can I do now?\nPlease, please give me your opinion.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: help me] \n\nokay so i might just be overreacting but like please help! so today i got the implant inserted and everything was all good except i got called into work and so i showed up because my job doesn‚Äôt require me to lift heavy stuff up which was the only thing they warned me about. however throughout the day i noticed that the gauze was placed from the insertion point to only the middle of the implant causing the other end to pop out. i didn‚Äôt want to move the gauze so i kept working with it like that. however as the day came to an end it became extremely sore to the point where it was painful to move my arm. is this normal? or it it possible that it snapped? i‚Äôm just really freaking out. should i fix the gauze? it‚Äôs really tight on my arm so could that have snapped it since it was only covering half of the implant and there was a lot of moving around? i‚Äôm off now and the pain went down but there‚Äôs like shockwaves of heat and pain that go throughout my arm. how can i check if it‚Äôs broken once i remove the gauze?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: could i be pregnant?] \n\nThis is my first month on birth control and I switched birth controls after the first few weeks and started another and am now on the placebo pills. Tonight is my third placebo pill but I have not gotten my period. I sometimes have taken the pill 2 hours late maximum but it is mixed hormone so I didn‚Äôt think it was a major problem. I started having sex on my 9th day on the new pills with condoms although some of the condoms got stuck in me when he pulled out leaving me to think that it possibly came off during, which means cum could‚Äôve gotten inside me. Am I pregnant? I‚Äôm worried that me not getting it means I‚Äôm pregnant but I‚Äôve also heard that can b normal?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: completely overwhelmed and completely new to birth control options] \n\nHi,\n\nI have birth control pills (Mylan) and I'm currently sexually active. I had plan b fuck my cycle last time but I want to get protected asap and want to start taking pills soon as possible. \n\nMy last period was from 23rd Jul- 28th Jul. Then I took plan B on the 28th then got my \"period\" on the 4th Aug - 8th Aug. Super weird. Anyway, I want to get started on the pills asap.\n\nWould it be okay to start taking Mylan starting today? \n\nAlso, would I get my periods (whenever that is) and do I continue taking pills when I get the period? And how would the placebo pills work in this case?\n\nI will definitely be visiting a planned parenthood center but I want to know what I'm walking into so any information on this would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: nightly leg cramps on lo loestrin fe] \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if this is a side effect of my birth control or something that is just happening. I‚Äôm at the end of my second month and I‚Äôve been having bad calf leg cramps at night. And that‚Äôs got me worried that I could have a blood clot. I read an article about how some girls have almost died from blood clots caused from their birth control and it all started with leg cramps so now I‚Äôm freaking out! I know if could be caused from multiple things but has anyone else on this pill had any similar things happen?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: possible pregnancy with condom/pullout/period?] \n\nMe and my girlfriend had sex almost 3 weeks ago for the first time since March. During quarantine she went off the pill so she was using no BC when we had sex. I used a condom, pulled out and she was on the second day of her period when we had sex. We had no more penetrative sex over the next few days and I only ejaculated on her upper body. She has been having some irregular bleeding/spotting for the last 2 and a half weeks and nausea along with intense stabbing pain. She has had irregular periods when she was younger and we were thinking this could be coming from her stopping birth control in mid March, as I‚Äôve read weird stuff can be going on with a women‚Äôs periods for a few months after stopping BC. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs basically impossible that she got pregnant but she is planning to take a test soon. Can anyone help to calm us down?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: panicking] \n\nSo my girlfriend and I, both young adults,  recently had sex with no condom,  but I pulled out and shes on minastrin 24....should I still be freaking about possible pregnancy?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: basically having a period in the middle of my cycle (on birth control pills)] \n\nhey guys,\n\nso i'm a little bit concerned by this. i've been on the pill for 6 months, always take it on time, and have never missed a pill. i'm on my sixth pack now and i'm in the middle of the second week. since i've been on the pill, i always have a little bit of bleeding in the middle of my cycle, but nothing alarming. this time i'm bleeding a fairly large amount for what i consider normal. it's basically like a period, and it hurts like one too. i have no idea why this is happening in the middle of my cycle. i haven't missed a pill or even been late on one.\n\nmy biggest fear is always pregnancy, but i'm pretty sure this isn't a symptom. it's happening right at the time i would normally be ovulating if i weren't on the pill, and that's not when implantation bleeding happens as far as i know. \n\ni really just want to make sure this doesn't mean my birth control isn't working. i do have sex at least once a week and my bf doesn't always pull out.\n\ndoes anyone know what this could be? is it normal or is there something wrong? is my birth control still effective? thanks!!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: iud spotting] \n\nHi guys,\n\nI‚Äôve had an IUD for a year now. At first I experienced a lot of pain with it to the point I was admitted to hospital because I was convinced it was put in wrong but since then my periods have become less painful but still heavy. \n\nHowever I haven‚Äôt had any spotting when I‚Äôve not been on my period. \n\nFast forward to a year later (now) I‚Äôm bleeding in between periods (well, only one, which is right now), probably enough to fill a couple liners a day at most and it‚Äôs kind of on and off. Is this anything to be worried about or is this normal? It‚Äôs only worrying me because it‚Äôs never happened before only just now? \n\nAny advice will be appreciated. I‚Äôm gonna check the strings when I have a shower next.\n\nThanks! X\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: weird occurrences on nexplanon... please help!!] \n\nOkay. So this is going to be a long post, but I need to make sure I can explain everything to get the best answer(s) possible. Any response helps me a lot! (I am a 21 year old female college student)\n\nI got the Nexplanon implant put in my arm in June of 2018. So, it‚Äôs been in there a little over a year and a half. I have had absolutely no issues with it - no weight gain, no breast pain, no spotting/periods, nothing since the day it was put in. I wasn‚Äôt worried about the lack of periods because 1) that‚Äôs why I got it in the first place and 2) I knew it was working.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started having unprotected sex in like September of 2019, but he has never ever finished in me. Fast forward to the beginning of February. My boyfriend and I had sex twice one day, I can‚Äôt remember the details but I know they were at least a couple hours apart from each other AND he peed in between. (Still never finished inside of me, but I know about precum and how there‚Äôs some slight chances it contains live sperm). That was some time at the very beginning of the month, then we had sex again on February 8th.\n\nBetween then, my nipples started getting really really tender, and my roommate jokingly mentioned that I might be pregnant, so of course I started freaking out and took 2 pregnancy tests - both came out negative, but it wasn‚Äôt very long after we had sex so who even knows if it was accurate. Then on February 11th, I started spotting lightly, which then turned into a period that required me to use a tampon. That ended on the 18th, and then between the 23rd and the 28th I started bleeding again, but lighter than the first time.\n\nWe did not have sex for the rest of February, because I was nervous about what was going on and also that I was bleeding so randomly. I took a pregnancy test March 3rd and another one March 11th, both came up negative. They were approximately 4-5 weeks after the time we had sex that I think I‚Äôm worried about (the time we had sex twice in a day). I read on the instructions that if you don‚Äôt pee for exactly 5 seconds that the test may be inaccurate so I keep thinking that I got a false negative because I messed something up.\n\nI really don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm pregnant, but yesterday I noticed that my right boob has gotten bigger. It is not tender or painful or anything of the sort, I just looked in the mirror and noticed it was bigger. I also noticed bumps on my areola that were never there previously, and I know they come out during pregnancy or hormone changes. I haven‚Äôt had a period since February. I have no idea if all of these things going on are because of my implant and just the changes in hormones since it‚Äôs been in for almost two years, or if I‚Äôm pregnant... I also don‚Äôt even know if this implant is still working or if it stopped working and that‚Äôs why these things are going on. I seen around so many times if you feel the implant it‚Äôs working but what if I got a defective one or something. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy over this thing\n\nI would talk to my parents or my boyfriend but I really can‚Äôt... I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to so this is basically my only source of information. Please help me if you can, anything that you can tell me will help me so much. I really appreciate it. If you need any further information, I‚Äôll tell you whatever, just ask! :)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: can i keep my iud after removal?] \n\nOn a scale of kind of weird to super weird, how weird is it to ask my doctor tomorrow if I can keep my Skyla IUD as a weird keepsake? I know some people keep their wisdom teeth after removal. \n\nHas anyone asked their doc this before when getting an IUD removed/replaced? I‚Äôm having it replaced with a Kyleena tomorrow! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i'm into my second pack of generess fe, and it feels like i'm ovulating...?] \n\nI could just be imagining it because I'm paying even more attention to my body with the birth control, but I swear it feels like I'm ovulating. I start the second week of my second pack today. I'm having a lot of discharge that I only have around the time of ovulation, I'm having light cramping, increased sex drive, body temperature feels higher...  \n\nIs this possible? Or is this just entirely in my head? If a hormonal birth control is not a high enough dosage for someone, could they still ovulate while taking it? I'd also like to add that I have taken it religiously at the same time and have not missed one pill. What gives? \n\nAs an aside, my long distance SO was going to be in town this weekend and we were planning on having some fun (can't have penetration at this time due to a septate hymen, but we were going to try outercourse). Should I hold off on doing this if this is a thing? \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: sex on the 7th day after mirena - did i mess up severly?] \n\nI had my Mirena inserted on Thursday 5th at 9am, and had unprotected sex on the following Thursday 12th at around 11pm. I had a complete mind blank when calculating the 7 days after insertion even though my OB STRESSED That I should use a barrier method till then. Does anyone have any experience with this? I have a feeling I might be over reacting, but I will take a pregnancy test at the right time regardless.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: getting nexplanon before my period?] \n\nI'm having Nexplanon inserted this Thursday, the 13th, but I don't start my period til Sept. 23rd. Is this okay? I know they say you can have it inserted at any point in your cycle, but I'm just nervous about side effects. Thanks for any advice!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i need reassurance.] \n\nI‚Äôve been on the pill for about a year and a half and I‚Äôm just about ready to stop taking them. This has not been a positive experience for me at all.\n\nI am a completely different person. I don‚Äôt ever feel happy, I cry just about daily, and the mood swings are worse than a rollercoaster. My personality has mellowed out and I‚Äôm either feeling fine or I‚Äôm miserable, happy is not an emotion I feel anymore. I think I‚Äôve mentally convinced myself that I hate sex and I‚Äôm not into my boyfriend anymore (it‚Äôs not true). I am NEVER in the mood, with him or just by myself. Sex is painful now because I can never get wet enough. Lube has become my best friend, but it doesn‚Äôt clear the mental fog I have so it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm not really ever in the mood.\n\nI am always so agitated, like a low-anger all the time. I feel like there is always a slight flame lit inside me and it‚Äôs like the flip of a switch to turn it into a roaring campfire. 0-100 real quick, all the time.\n\nI was hesitant to go on the in the first place and basically only did for peace of mind. We‚Äôve been together for 4 years and there was a 2.5ish year period of time where I wasn‚Äôt using BC. I am TERRIFIED of becoming or being pregnant. I‚Äôm also terrified of my boyfriend ‚Äúreleasing‚Äù inside me. If there was a phobia-type term for all that, I have it. Even on the pill we still use condoms. Now I‚Äôm terrified to go off of the pill. Part of me worries I‚Äôll get pregnant, the other part worries that maybe all these issues aren‚Äôt caused from the pill. I doubt the latter is the case but I think these pills have also messed with me so much mentally, I can‚Äôt think straight or for myself anymore.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to keep trying new pills. I don‚Äôt think the hormones are good for me. I‚Äôve thought about the copper IUD but every part of it terrifies me. I‚Äôd rather not do it.\n\nI can‚Äôt even remember who I am off of these pills. I‚Äôd love some reassurance on what to do, or if anyone else feels or has felt the same way.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: heavy spotting on continuous bc due to stress/anxiety] \n\nI've been taking continuous birth control for the past 4 years and on the rare occasion I have spotting when i'm nearing the end of a pack, which is fine. Last week something happened in my life which is causing major stress/anxiety and I have no appetite and haven't been eating as much and since then everyday i've been having cramps and heavier than normal spotting. Maybe TMI but I can feel the tiny rush of blood coming out everyday but it's not enough to be considered a period (at least compared to how heavily I used to bleed not on birth control) but it does last most of the day.\n\nIs there anything I should be doing? Now i'm stressed out about this bleeding on top of what i'm already stressed about. I just needed to rant. :(\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: is it normal to experience these things on the pill?] \n\nHello everyone. I‚Äôve been experiencing some side effects that have me a little concerned. Some background info:\n\nI‚Äôve been taking the bc pill Enpresse for 3 years without issue. Enpresse is apparently a generic brand for Triphasil. Well when I went to the pharmacist this past time, they gave me Levonest 28 instead and the pharmacist was very rude and refused to order in Enpresse when I said I‚Äôd prefer it. \n\nI understand that levonest 28 and Enpresse are both generic versions of triphasil. However, since starting levonest, I have experienced nausea, dizziness, vaginal pain, headaches, moodiness, and weight gain. I just started my second pack and am wondering why I would be experiencing all of this when this brand is supposed to be identical to the Enpresse I used to take. They literally have the same ingredients. \n\nLike I said, I was on Enpresse for years without side effects and I‚Äôm wondering if I can expect these new side effect to go away after a few packs. I feel like a stranger in my own body. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nAlso note: I had my period on time with these pills, so I am not pregnant, and I do understand that no one here can diagnose me and that I will probably need to speak with my doctor to confirm. But while I build up the courage to see my doctor (I have a fear of doctors) I was just wondering if I could get some peace of mind. Thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i tried xulane and hated it.] \n\nI tried to use Xulane for about three months. It did regulate my period but I had awful side effects. I was constantly bloated and had downright unreasonable food cravings. I also had really bad headaches that made it difficult to be at work or school. I was in bed all day which is very unlike me. I had zero energy. The last day I took it I was very emotional and angry. I went to the bathroom and found the patch half peeled and stuck to my pants. It took about a week to lose all of the side effects. I am kinda reluctant to try anything else because of my experience. Is there a method that will have less side effects?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: why am i having a period while taking microgynon 30?] \n\nHi there! I started my pill free week on October 13th and had my withdrawal bleed from 15th - 19th. I started my pill as normal the following day. \n\nI‚Äôve missed one pill in total and started my period on the 31st of October, despite still taking the pill and only being 12 days since my last bleed. Why is this happening? Is it normal? \n\nI‚Äôm in agony, my period is heavy. Should I bother to continue taking the pill? I‚Äôm so annoyed as I‚Äôve had a period every year on my birthday for 11 years. I was hoping the pill would prevent it from happening this year, but my body is absolutely determined to ruin my birthday!!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: plan b, condom broke four days ago. period is three days late and we‚Äôre scared.] \n\nTitle explains it all. Last Friday(12/14) we had sex and at some point in time the condom must‚Äôve broken. After I finished I noticed and it was really terrifying for both my girlfriend and I. I rushed out to get Plan B and quickly got it to her within an hour after sex. She had some food with it too because apparently you‚Äôre not supposed to take it on an empty stomach. She was supposed to get her period the day after and it hasn‚Äôt come yet(now waiting on the third day) and we‚Äôre super nervous. The official Plan B site says to take a test a week after, but I don‚Äôt want any false positives and yet I keep seeing people here say three weeks, which do we do??\n\nAny comfort or stories would be really nice. We‚Äôre both super scared.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: had an accident, need advice!] \n\nHi everyone,\n\nSo I've been sleeping with a girl from POF for a few weeks who is quite big (maybe 250?).  She is on birth control pills, and we use a condom as well.  However tonight, after we finished, I pulled out and didn't notice the condom did not come with me.  A few seconds later she pulled the condom out of her, but it had considerably less stuff in it than it should have.  Presumably it leaked out after I pulled out and it came off.\n\nShe has offered to get the morning after pill if I want, but otherwise she won't.  I'm really freaked out about pregnancy but I said I'd sleep on it.  I don't want to put her through getting the morning after pill if it isn't necessary, but I'm so freaked out that I'm having a hard time thinking about it rationally.\n\nReddit, should I ask her to get the morning after pill?  Or am I panicking over nothing here?\n\nThanks for the advice!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: acne on birth control pills] \n\nI have been on Aviane for around a month and have been experiencing the worst acne of my life. I have multiple large and painful cysts all over my face, mostly concentrated around my chin. I know that you are supposed to keep with it for 3 months, but I don't know if I can handle this. my skin was almost completely clear before going on the pill. will my skin eventually clear up? \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: copper iud day 3 - does it get better?] \n\n22 years old. Never have had kids. I have been off of oral hormonal birth control pills for about 5 months (was on for about 8 years). And have been off of NuvaRing for 2 months. (Went off of hormonal because it messed with my libido too much). I got the Copper IUD put in as a form of emergency contraception (knowing I would eventually get it/try it in the future, so I kind of just bit the bullet and did it after the condom broke). But now I‚Äôm wishing i would‚Äôve done more research. The insertion almost made me vomit. Im on day 3 and the cramps are better and not as extreme and persistent (but still there off and on), spotting still, and a crazy amount of discharge on Day 3. I know that it can cause periods to be heavy, longer, crampier etc. but holy crap will the insertion effects subside?! Is day 3 still a bit early to be worried? What was your expierence? I just imagine it never going away! Also they never told me about checking the strings? Is that something I should be doing? I got this done at Planned Parenthood. Also, what side effects should i look out for? I remember them telling me some in the moment but I was crazy nervous.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: stubborn weight gain after stopping the pill (among other symptoms)] \n\nI was on the pill for about 10 years. Over time while on the pill I began to notice that my sex drive was almost non existent regardless of my loving relationship. After reading online of how the pill can sometimes cause low libido I decided to stop taking it. The great news is my sex drive came back! However, I began to experience a slew of symptoms I attributed to coming off the pill such as nausea, bloating, and a bit of weight gain. Two weeks ago (I stopped the pill about a month ago) I started working out hard everyday and eating right to try and loose weight. However, I have seen ZERO changes to my weight (I know my body and with how hard I'm working out I should have seen a change by now) and I am constantly bloated. Anyone have any experience with this? Reading online maybe it's a hormone imbalance? How do I fix this! Help!!!! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: a ball of anxiety over iud removal...] \n\nHey guys! I‚Äôve just discovered this community and I‚Äôm blown away at how wonderful everyone here seems to be.\n\nSo, here‚Äôs the deal. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 12. At 14, after being put on the pill to help with the PCOS symptoms, my periods started getting super heavy and lasting for months at a time. To make a long story short, I bled so much that I needed blood transfusions and had to have a D&amp;C to scrape out the contents of my uterus and stop the bleeding. I tried a few different pills and they all resulted in the same thing. I ended up having 3 D&amp;Cs, and during the last one in 2014, they placed in a Mirena IUD while I was in surgery. This really worked at stopping the bleeding and I was free to live a normal life again (Albeit, without a period). \n\nSo now, I‚Äôm 21, engaged, and thinking about children in the near future. I wanted some time before we start trying to conceive to work out the kinks, figure out if I can have a normal, manageable cycle, and figure out if I actually even ovulate. I scheduled my removal for this Friday, and I have to admit, I‚Äôm nervous as hell. Every account I‚Äôve read has either said it was super painful, or that they felt practically nothing. Almost everyone compares it to the insertion though, and because I wasn‚Äôt conscious to experience that, I have no point of reference. I‚Äôve tried watching some technical videos to relieve some of my anxiety and nervousness, but it sends me into a full blown panic attack each time I even think about it. I have some PTSD-related issues due to the massive amounts of pain I was in after the surgeries on my uterus, so that‚Äôs definitely not helping. Finally, after dozens of OB-GYN appointments, I‚Äôm just now able to somewhat tolerate the smallest speculum they have at my office without completely panicking and freaking out. \n\nI know this is kind of an odd situation, but can anyone tell me what their removal was like without using insertion as a reference point? Or what I should expect during the procedure?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: someone tell me whether or not i should be worried?] \n\nMade a throwaway for this. My gf and I(M) both 17, had a condom break the other night, and I did not notice until after i ejaculated inside her. She has been getting the Depo-Provera for the last 7 or so months. What are the chances she is pregnant? Do i have nothing to worry about? I guess i just want something to help ease the nervousness haha, thanks\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: is my girlfriend pregnant?] \n\nMy partner and I have regular sex; at least once a week, up to three times a week. She is using the contraceptive patch and we don't use condoms on top of this ever. \n\nRecently, about 2-3 weeks ago, we had a scare that she was pregnant. Missed her period, boobs were sore, she felt bloated a lot so I managed to convince her to get a pregnancy test, even though she was adamant she's fine. The result tested as not pregnant but with recent developments I can't shake the feeling she did it wrong somehow, and really is pregnant.\n\nSo heres the recent developments:\n\nI went away for a week and once back, she told me she'd missed a period again. At this stage id forgotten about the pregnancy scare so I brushed it off as nothing. Then I found out her boobs were still sore, which I can say was never really like this in the past, so this brought me back into anxiously assuming she's pregnant. Now I do have OCD so I wanna convince myself I'm over-obsessing the situation but once we got back to her house and she got changed, I couldn't help but noticed her stomach looked larger. And what scared me the most, what the disproportionate 'larger' that usually comes with pregnancy. E.g. if you gain weight, the extra fat goes everywhere, not just to the stomach, but this was purely the stomach being larger.\n\nAre pregnancies noticable at 2 months pregnant? Like would it be this noticeable at only 2 months?\n\nI know you might be thinking just talk to her, but she would not get the pregnancy test the first time for ages and now that it showed negative, if I asked again ill look stupid. I really want to know if theres ways I can tell if she's pregnant or not before actually asking.\n\nTo conclude/ TL;DR \n\nGirlfriend misses two months worth of periods, boobs hurt, noticeable but not massive enlargement of the stomach, regular sex using only the contraceptive patch, did take a pregnancy test but tested negative, still extremely worried she's pregnant.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: can sex drive improve by switching from pills to hormonal iud?] \n\nI'm 27 years old, been on the pill \\(estrogen\\) for \\~6\\-7 years now. For years I never had any side effects \\(that I'm aware of\\) so I never considered switching methods \\(don't fix what is not broken mentality\\). HOWEVER, for the past 1\\-2 years now I have the strong suspicion that the pill is completely killing my sex drive. I blamed it first on work stress, getting older... and just sex dying down after being with my partner for over 5 years... but no, it's REALLY low now and I really think it might be the pill. And either way, I am sick and tired of being on the pill.\n\nTherefore, I want to switch to something different. Right now I'm considering some kind of hormonal IUD \\(I will probably be trying for kids in the next 3\\-5 years so I think the copper IUD would be overkill. Also I don't want to endure the terrible periods\\). I was recommended to go for Kyleena, since it has the lowest hormonal load. \n\nBUT, it is still hormonal BC... Has anyone had any experience with improved sex drive/libido when switching from the pill to a hormonal IUD? Is there hope?? :\\(\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: afraid to try my iud out] \n\nI finally got my second period on my Copper IUD (T380A, similar to Paragard) after all this anxiety I had over getting pregnant despite sex with condoms... I thought I'd get over my anxiety over pregnancy by now but I still can't wrap my head around having sex without condoms and relying solely on the IUD. :'( \n\nDoes anyone have advice? will it just take some time getting used to?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: missed pill, bad timing.] \n\nHey Reddit, I have a serious question. \n\nMy girlfriend (21F) missed an active (combination) pill on her 3rd day of a new pill pack (the 24th). I know it's a pretty bad time to miss one in the first week, but she doubled up the very next day. We then had condomless sex on the 26th, in which the pullout method was used, but I stupidly went back in a few minutes after, so it's very possible, in fact I would guarantee that even just a little tiny bit got inside her. We weren't too worried at first, but as time passed we followed up just about 24 hours later with a Plan B, just to be safe. She's been taking her pill consistently ever since she missed that day. It's now been just over a week since that intercourse and everything has been fine thus far. Realistically, in this scenario, what are the chances of an unexpected pregnancy? I'm trying not to worry too much, but I can't get out of the \"it's always possible\" mindset. Any opinions or stories are appreciated.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: should i take plan b?] \n\nMy boyfriend and I had sex earlier today but the condom came off at some point and didn‚Äôt realize til after we finish. I am on birth control but I‚Äôm about two -three pounds over the 165. And I‚Äôve been taking it for about 3 weeks. Am I still safe or will I need to take plan b? Sorry my anxiety is going all over the place.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: cooper iud side effects?? lower right abdominal pain??] \n\nSo I got my copper iud on Dec 19 when I was on my period and my cramps were crazy painful.  I was pretty regular and experienced very mild cramps before getting iud.  Had sex on the 25th (merry dickmas) Then on dec 29 I felt symptoms of a UTI infection and was on antibiotics for 7 days (macrobid).  Then on Jan 3 I went for a check up visit with my dr to check my strings which she said was completely ok. (She was all up in there Tryna find my cervix coz apparently mines all the way backed in there). The next morning I felt a some pelvic pain which didn‚Äôt really last long at all so I didn‚Äôt put much thought into it but then later the evening I noticed a light pink stain whenever I wiped after peeing.  The next day after that, I started having brown discharge and mild pain mostly on my lower right abdomen.  Now I may be just being paranoid over nothing but I did the bad thing and searched my symptoms on google which only made things worse because now I‚Äôm wondering if I have PID or if I have an ectopic pregnancy or if I‚Äôm experiencing ovulation spotting?? Or implantation bleeding?? Or just experiencing a reg side effect of a copper iud?? I noticed that my breasts are swollen and that usually occurs when my period is coming but my period isn‚Äôt suppose to come until the 20th?? HELP\n\nI‚Äôm sorry if this explanation was really messy but has anyone experienced this?? Any advice?? x.x\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i take avaine at the same time everyday but i use pullout with it, am i pregnant?] \n\nIts been 10 days and I havent felt sore breasts or anything, Ive been doing my best with avaine but I was taking strep throat meds the night I took my first Hormone pill this week.\n\n\n\nI have horrible anxiety and probably just need to relax but please some kind of reassurance will really help me Ive heard too many horror stories of people using pill + condom and still being pregnant\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: 8 months after going off the pill, and still no period.] \n\nAny other ladies have any experience with this? I began taking Sprintec 4 years ago, and after having terrible side effects from it for a year I went off for about 9 months. Following that I began taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, and last June decided to stop taking it for no particular reason. It is now February, and I still haven't gotten back into the swing of things. No spotting, no anything. According to my doctor it could take upwards of 2 years to regulate back, but I'm hoping to hear some stories from you guys to put myself at ease.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: expiered nuvaring... help!] \n\nSo in 2 weeks I will put in the last ring in my box of three. However I have forgotten the date I had it dispensed to me. I have a feeling I got the new box one week before I was due to take a ring out. In the information it says it has a shelf life of 4 months when out of refrigeration. I'm super paranoid and not thinking straight, will I be safe and protected if I use the remaining ring or should I go to my doctor and get a new batch of 3 just to be certain that I'll be protected? Thanks in advance. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: birth control consult] \n\nSo I had originally made a post freaking out about getting my IUD today, but turns out it was just the consultation.  I was nervous for the whole thing my bp was 121/106 üòÇüòÇand I had a full pelvic exam. Everything seemed to go well though! \nMy ob/gyn was really nice although acted kinda weird about me wanting and IUD. Like she suggested several other methods (pill, implant, and ring) and I had to tell her at least 2x that I definitely wanted an IUD. \n\nShe has prescribed me a Valium for the 8th when I‚Äôm going to actually get the insertion done. She told me that I‚Äôll be getting the Kyleena since it‚Äôs smaller that Mirena! Wish me luck and leave me any tips or anything lol\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: first time ever on bc and i worry too much.] \n\nSo I've been with my BF for 3 years and I finally decided to be safe and get on the pill. I have a weird history with my health, I was anorexic for 3 years and completely lost my period during that time. So I was put on hormonal therapy to help get it back and it didn't work, but the pills made me very moody and anxious for the first 3 days (I only took them for 10 days as prescribed).\n\nI've also tried taking anti-depression and anxiety medication for a day and stopped because my body reacted horribly on the first day. I can say that Im a lot better since I've overcome my anorexia though. \n\nNow I've taken my first BC pill and I'm so nervous about the upcoming mood swings and side effects, I'm just a very paranoid person and am just looking for some reassurance on here since I don't have many friends IRL to talk about my worries...\n\nI was given Taytulla to take (it's a low dose estrogen pill. About 20 mcg) but now I could have sworn my chest started to hurt or my leg was hurting, I know there's a high chance those were all in my head since I worry a lot, but now I'm just wondering about how long does it take to start feeling side effects? On first day? The end of first week?\n\nSo sorry about just coming in here and whining, but I just needed to go somewhere to let this out. Thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: cramps around ovulation? am i freaking out??? 19f] \n\nSo my boyfriend and I had sex twice last week on the same night. I was in the middle of ovulating according to Clue app. We used condoms and pulled out. I am not on any other birth control. \n\nThe next day I just had the weirdest, most unfamiliar cramping. Like only on one side. I know that can be ovulation pain. I just stopped the pill two months ago so I don't know if this is regular for me. Very pin pointed pain for about 30 mins, where I had to lay down and couldn't really walk. Really painful. Today, like 4 days later I have the same kind of pin pointed pain, this time more toward the center of my uterus (and more on a different side). \n\nPlease tell me that cannot be implantation cramping. I've convinced myself im pregnant even though we used a condom AND pulled out. I was stupid to have sex while ovulating and not on BC. \\\\\n\nAm I at risk of being pregnant? Could that be implantation cramping the day after sex. \n\nGetting an IUD next month so hopefully that will help reduce my anxiety about getting pregnant. Its starting to drive me crazy.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: bleeding 8th day in a row (doesn't look like it's ending)] \n\nSo I started birth control pills almost 3 weeks ago. 8 days ago I started bleeding and I still haven't stopped yet, and it doesn't look like it's stopping anytime soon.

I had a few cups of Traditional Medicinal‚Äôs Throat Coat Tea over the last 3 days, maybe like 6 or so. It just clicked in my brain on how some herbs can affect birth control pills so I ran to look at the ingredients. The main ones I saw was licorice root and slippery elm, marshmallow root and bitter fennel fruit? I‚Äôll try to attach the box picture. I don‚Äôt think they would have an affect, but was wondering if anyone knew something I didn‚Äôt? \n\nI feel silly for even asking this, but any info would be greatly appreciated. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: new to paraguard and late period] \n\nI got my Paraguard IUD in the middle of January and it has been a smooth experience so far! I did have light bleeding the first two weeks after I had it inserted due to the procedure and then due to stopping the pill. I got it on time last month, but for this month, I am approaching two weeks late and am very nervous. I had spotting for one day the week I was supposed to get it and thought that would be the beginning of my period but it wasn't. Has anybody else had any experiences like this and if so what happened? I know it is still in place because I can still feel my strings.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: started the pill this week, are these side effects normal?] \n\nHiya, I was prescribed Eloine (which I believe is Yaz in the US?), a combination pill, for my acne and periods and have been taking it since the start of my cycle on Monday. For reference I‚Äôm 18, not sexually active.\n\nOn the first day (sorry this is gross) I had pretty bad diarrhoea that evening (which is something I rarely experience), and i was woken up that night with agonising cramps, I‚Äôve never been woken up by painful cramps before but the pain was excruciating. On Tuesday I couldn‚Äôt leave the house because I felt nauseous and my stomach generally felt very unsettled, with very painful cramps.\n\nLast night I again was woken up with excruciating pain, ended up crying myself to sleep in exhaustion. Throughout the day my stomach has felt very unsettled, but the pain hasn‚Äôt been as bad.\n\nIn terms of my bleeding it‚Äôs been fairly heavy. My period was dead on time for once (it‚Äôs ususlly at least a week late) so I‚Äôm surprised by how heavy it is. I am dreading tonight in case I am woken up with the pain again.\n\nIs this just my body getting used to it, and is it all mostly ordinary? I‚Äôve read the leaflet and these are symptoms. I suppose I‚Äôm mostly wondering how long it will take for this to be over! \n\nThanks :-)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: kinda freaking out. took combo pill 3 hours late cause i forgot to take it when my alarm went off.] \n\nWill I be okay if I have unprotected sex?

Recently started Alesse 28~ 2 weeks ago. I just wanted to know if anyone else has been on Alesse 28 and experienced side effects in the form of mood swings (eg going from angry to crying to nervous) and slight weight gain of about 3 lbs so far. The weight gain especially bothers me bc i struggle with an eating disorder. How long did this last for you? Is it worth pushing through the symptoms?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: could i be imagining pregnancy symptoms? please help!] \n\nI'm having a pregnancy scare, basically I think I messed up somewhere in my birth control and started a new pack a day late by accident. I started the pack three days after my last period ended. I had sex without a condom on the day that I started the pack. I've been really stressed out about it to the point of not being able to think of anything else. I also had a panic attack because of it. I've started experiencing nausea (throughout the day), gas, light abdominal cramping and back pain. Is it possible that my symptoms are a result of stress? Like some kind of placebo effect? \n\nI've been keeping all this to myself because I would hate to make my boyfriend worry for no reason. Trying to keep my cool for his sake. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: pregnancy anxiety and weird symptoms (tmi) (18f)] \n\nI‚Äôve been on Alysena 28 for a little less than a year. Never have missed a pill and I always have a withdrawal bleed. My pill is very low estrogen. I take probiotics and cranberry pills regularly. \n\nThis month / new pack i had to change the time I take my pill to around 11pm, from 5pm when I usually would take it due to not wanting to the pill while I was on the clock at work. I didn‚Äôt have sex for 7 days just to be extra safe. Last week a few days after sex I had some egg white mucus that resembled that of ovulation. Today I woke up with light spotting, I ended up having sex and was spotting again afterwards. Not spotting now. My placebo week isn‚Äôt due for 4 days. TMI - Off and on this entire month I‚Äôve had fairly loose bowel movements in the morning, around 8-10 hours after I would take my pill. Again kind of out of the blue symptom for me. \n\nFor whatever reason I am so scared that I‚Äôve had a pill failure and that I‚Äôm pregnant. My partner and I are monogamous so we don‚Äôt use condoms and I usually let him - finish - inside. Do I have a rational cause for concern given my circumstances? \n\nNot trying to overreact here; In my family and among my friends birth control and sex is VERY taboo. I really enjoy having sex but I‚Äôm always so afraid of an accidental pregnancy which in turn makes me feel so shameful and embarrassed. Just don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it and I‚Äôm scared.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: calm a girl down... combo pill side effects] \n\nSo, I am in my 20's have been having sex with my boyfriend for a few months. I am naturally an anxious person. I went and got a prescription for birth control last week because in the 6 months I've been having sex with my boyfriend we've had a condom break leading to me taking plan B and then this last period my cycle was delayed 5 days, likely due to being sick earlier in the month, and that caused a ton of stress. Like I said... anxious person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend is totally cool with condoms and even pulls out. He's the best! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now to the point of this thing. I was prescribed Sronyx and was given a generic of it. It is a combination pill, so my question is for people who are on combined OCPs or have been. How do you deal with the potential risk of stroke or heart attack? I know a risk of \\~6/100,000 is pretty small, but that could be devastating. I've had two girls that I know of have complications in this way. One had a stroke around age 20 on Yaz and literally had to learn how to read again. I am not sure what happened to her after college. Another, almost died from a blood clot in her lung.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do you guys deal with the thoughts of potential risks?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am due to take this thing on Sunday, and I am not sure if I feel ok with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Aware of risks of hormonal BC feels like a big risk to me. Wondering how everyone else manages.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: questions about iuds] \n\nI have been on microgesten 1/20 for a about a year now and while I like how nice it makes my skin look and that it regulates my period and everything, but I have gained a ton of weight since I've been on it and almost never want to have sex any more. I've heard women have had an easier time losing weight when they stop taking the pill and also that their periods come back with a vengeance. I've been considering an IUD but not really sure how comfortable I am with the whole idea, also thinking of just going back to condoms. I am in a long term relationship and started taking the pill about a year into our relationship. I've never been to the gyno before and just get my pills from the family doctor. I'm also nervous about going to the gyno, should I wax before I go? Also, how much would an IUD cost with insurance?\n\np.s. sorry for the poor grammar! \nedit: I also turn 23 this month so I really think it's a good time to start going to the gyno.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: help ease my paranoia?] \n\nI had unprotected sex last night and ended up taking my birth control pill a few hours later than my usual time this morning.

I know antibiotics make your birth control less effective, so me and my boyfriend always used a condom. However, last night it broke and I am on my period currently. Help idk what to do!!! Do I take plan b?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i.u.d.] \n\nI have recently rekindle the relationship with a young lady I haven't laid with in over 20 years. We had the talk, decided against even a condom. She said she had an IUD and I promised not to ejaculate in her. Incredible sex ensues . I look at my penis the following day and the head has red poke marks all over it. I do recall feeling it but I didn't mention it. Is it possible that I could have hurt her? How exactly do I bring this up? Is this normal?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: is a copper iud worth it? advice?] \n\nI really need some advice, so within the next year, I will be married and with my SO, (I‚Äôve never had sex either, we‚Äôre long distance) I do not consider taking any kind of hormonal birth control, the best option I‚Äôve seen is a copper iud, but It gives me absolutely sickening anxiety thinking about getting it placed in, the widening and dilating, I‚Äôm so scared, I know it sounds 5th grade stupid to be scared of doctors seeing your private areas, but on the low, I kinda have trauma from a sexual assault and it just scares me imagining a stranger (doctor or not) seeing me so vulnerable. \nI know it‚Äôs stupid, my significant other thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous I‚Äôm piss scared, \nBut it just makes me shake thinking about it, I also heard your period gets a lot worse, (I already usually have long periods and heavy cramps ) but I will not take a chance in hell getting pregnant, so please tell me if it‚Äôs worth my embarrassment and pain. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: copper iud - will the spotting ever stop? need advice!] \n\nSo I went for a gyn check-up after having the copper IUD for two months. I've been bleeding and spotting constantly the whole time. I told her about this problem and how it affects my sex life, how the constant use of tampons and panty liners are causing even more yeast infections and BV as I already struggle with this. She told me that the spotting and bleeding won't get better and that it basically was no point in waiting as the copper is hormonal free and meant to cause inflammation and therefore bleeding in the uterus. My IUD was in it's right place. She recommended the Kyleena instead but I really don't want to use hormones obviously.  \n\n\nI was so disappointed to hear that it won't get better. I paid a lot of money for it but now the most tempting thing is to not use any birth control at all. I'm so tired of trying BC for it to not work. Do any of you have any advice on this? Will it ever get better?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: condom broke and pulled out instantly, no cum.] \n\n Hello! I was having sex with my girlfriend last night and noticed the condom snapped, i thankfully pulled out 1-2 seconds after it happened but, of course, we are worried it might have been to late. Even though i didnt cum at all and i used a spermicide condom i still fear there might be a chance she is pregnant. Has anyone else had something similar happen? Should i be concerned?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: my doctor has agreed to put in paragard even though i haven't had a child (we are adopting)....i have questions and concerns.] \n\nSo there it is ladies give me the good, bad, and ugly of a copper IUD before I go get one next week.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: iud adjustment] \n\nI have recently got the Kyleena IUD (about a month ago) and have had spotting on and off since. In addition to the spotting there is a different odour that I think is a result of constantly having blood in there. I had the Mirena in the past and had this for approx. 7 months before having it removed. I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and how you managed to get through it? I am finding it hard on my relationship/sex life as i've been having to avoid it until things are better.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: pelvic pain after iud removal?] \n\nSo, long short story, I was on the pills for almost 7 years, stopped using it and was clean of hormones for a few years. About a year ago tried some different pills and hated the hormones feeling in me, so I tried the copper IUD. I HATED EVERY SINGLE SECOND. \nI am pretty resistant to pain, but the IUD insertion hurted so much I almost puked, to have sex it was painful, and for the icing on my cake... My body expelled the IUD. With my period. Like???? \nI don't have kids, I consider myself a healthy person, and I've never had cramps on my life before the IUD. \n\nNow I have this pelvic pain on my left side, which according to the doctor, it could be a small cyst on my ovary caused by the pills, but since I don't have the fever, she wants to wait to see if it goes away. OOOOR, it could be from the trauma the IUD caused on my body. \n\nDid anyone have bad reactions after removing the IUD?\n\nNow I will try the Nuvaring and hopefully it will be good. Otherwise I'll try the hormonal IUD :( \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: how early can side effects start?] \n\nHi there! Yesterday I've started taking the pill for the first time. This is a first for me, so I'm not sure when side effects first start appearing. All throughout today, I've had some on-and-off chest pains. Nothing too painful, it just feels like light pinch in my chest. I'm not sure if it's from the pill. I'm thinking it's probably me just having a bit of anxiety and stress since I just started my period yesterday as well. My cramps make me feel like total crap. I figured I should keep taking the pills until my period is over, and if it doesn't get any better I'll stop taking them, but I thought I'd get some more insight on this. Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? Is it fine to continue taking them for now?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: pregnancy paranoia! spotting and a heavy feeling in my lower stomach] \n\nI'm worrying myself to death about the possibility of being pregnant even though I'm sure it's very unlikely. \n\nI've been on the pill for over a year and I'm really good at taking it consistently. I had about a week and a half of spotting 3 pill packs ago so I went straight into a new pack and skipped the week off. The next period was normal, or as normal as my period is on the pill, but then I had spotting again about a two weeks ago. It was light brown in color, extremely light flow, and lasted about a week (same as the last time). I'm now feeling a bit of lower back cramps and a 'heavy' type feeling in my lower abdomen. \n\nIs there a possibility of being pregnant or am I worrying about nothing? Whenever a new 'symptom' pops up I dwell on it and seem to make it more prominent. \n\nMy next period should be in about a week and a half according to where I am in my pill pack. Would it be of any use to take a test now? Or just wait until I miss a period (if that happens anyway)? \n\nIs it as simple as switching my birth control?\n\nAny advice, especially reassurance, is greatly appreciated. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: the hell of hormones... combined pill.] \n\n**Background**\n\nI'm 23 and from the uk. It's wonderfully easy to get access to free contraceptive here. I first went on the combined pill (progesterone + estrogen) when I was 18. I as in foster care since I was 12, and my foster mum and social services had tried to get me to go on the pill since I was 14. (teen pregnancy in kids in foster care are very high) But I was adamantly against it.  \n\n\nI made a decision to come off it a couple of years ago for a year. I wanted to make sure my natural cycle was healthy as contraceptive pills can mask the symptoms of fertility problems. That went fine, no problems. But when I went to get back on the pill I was put on progesterone only. I had to deal with non-stop spotting. so after 4 months opted to change back to the Combined pill. And I'm now a hormonal mess. \n\n\nMy wonderful boyfriend is finding it hilarious. And is buying me excessive quantities of chocolate and tidying up for me. \n\n\n**The hell of hormones**\nThe other day we were talking and He remembered what gingham was. (its a type of fabric pattern) And I burst into tears. To tell you the truth I'm welling up a little now thinking about it. \n\n\nHe mentions kittens and I cry. He mentions getting a kitten and I cry.  He gets me chocolate and I cry. He remembers a random type of fabric I told him about and I cry. He asked if I wanted to go for cream tea and I cry. I think he's enjoying this a little bit much. \n\n\"hey sweetie, remember when I remembered gingham?\"... I cried. He comforted me with a smug face. \n\n\n\nWHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING! I'm a classic prim and proper 1950's brit. \nYou don't cry! \n\nYou show your appreciation by making your man a victoria sponge with home made jam and do it all in stockings and an apron and nothing else. \n\nYou reward offers of afternoon tea out with home made roast dinner. \n\n\n\nBut no I'm bursting into tears every two minutes. \n\n\nThis pill is killing me! How long will this last!!!!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: its gonna be a weird discussion thursday....] \n\nSo I posted about switching from the implant to the copper IUD a few weeks ago and finally I have it all planned out. I would have preferred to have all the procedures done in one office all in the same appointment but......my doctor stated they dont keep the copper in office and they dont know when OB will have them back in. So I have a PAP/breast exam with my doctor at 10:30 and then going over to planned parenthood for the removal of the implant and insertion of the IUD. I know it's not a huge deal, but I almost feel like I'm cheating on my doctor? üòÇüòÇ I hope the conversation isint as awkward as I think it will be \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: continuous birth control, late period, had sex] \n\nSo I'm in a bit of a weird situation and I'm not sure how to word this in a title. Im also on mobile, so i apologize. Im getting pretty anxious about this.\n\nI take my birth control continuously, so i don't get my period. I try to take the placebo pills every couple of months just to keep things regulated.\n\nThis time it has been about 4-5 months without my period, but I started the sugar pills on Wednesday. I usually get my period by Saturday, but come today, still nothing. I had sex yesterday and I'm worried about two things:\n\n1) is there something wrong or a reason why i haven't gotten my period yet, or is my cycle just screwed up since i haven't had my period in 4-5 months?\n\n2) could having sex yesterday put me at risk for pregnancy since ive been off the pill for a few days with no period?\n\nI haven't had any period symptoms, no cramps or anything. I feel a little cramped now but it could be the anxiety over this. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: thank you to this sub - my 1 year bc update (pills)] \n\nI wanted to share my experience on pills as a 1 year update! I'm 20 and have been through quite a ride with birth control but figured this is a good place to share my experience. I started taking birth control pills pretty much exactly a year ago and wanted to also thank this sub for always being a great resource for me. I'd started pills because my boyfriend and I knew we'd eventually start having sex (we'd only been dating for 2-3 months at that point so we just wanted to take the precautions well in advance). The ideas of an IUD or anything really invasive scares the hell out of me so I decided to talk to my OBGYN about going on pills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started on Blisovi24Fe as my first brand 1 year ago, and it was honestly terrible. The brand itself was definitely not right for me (I'm sure for others it works well, just wasn't for me) and I became very depressed very quickly. I would cry randomly and get so depressed that I didn't want to even get out of bed. I'm in college so obviously that was super, super bad. I have no history of depression and I knew that it was just from the hormones. I remember that I would be okay and going about my day, and then all of a sudden my whole mood would change and I would feel awful and sad for no reason. It was really rough but a few weeks later I guess my body adjusted so I was pretty much back to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen in February (6 months later), I became very depressed again. I'd had some bouts of depression/anxiety between the beginning of this story and now, but it was a super weird, sudden flare up that lasted for a week or two. I knew it was pretty much just because of the pills/stress combo but realized I could NOT take this anymore, especially given how random these flares were. I decided to go to student health at my school and talk to a professional there to switch brands. She switched me the same day and I began on Sprintec. I have not experienced any problems with it so far from the depression/anxiety aspect at all. The only thing is that my periods are very heavy on this brand and I get bad cramps, which is kinda annoying since easing those symptoms was part of the reason I liked the idea of birth control to begin with (aside from safe sex). However I'd MUCH rather deal with that then any of the emotional issues I had on Blisovi so I don't really care that much. I feel normal and happy and I was fearful that I wouldn't feel the same again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRant part over. Now for gratitude: I read many times on this thread about experiences of people switching brands. I read those types of post so many times when I was weighing my options of what to do last year. I am pretty stubborn and wanted to be one-and-done with the brand I was on but this thread really helped convince me to just go switch already! I just wanted to say thank you thank you THANK YOU to all the wonderful, helpful advice I always receive here. I don't have many female friends who are sexually active or on birth control for that matter, so it's great to have this community to help ease my concerns. Thank you guys, truly :)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: skyla questions] \n\nI‚Äôve posted about my cramps with Skyla but they‚Äôre like never ending! I take midol and it doesn‚Äôt do anything. My heating pad works sometimes. I have what I would describe as period cramps in my uterus and in my back. These cramps cause me to go to the bathroom (#2) more often. I noticed a light LIGHT blood whenever I went to the bathroom whenever I wiped. I got it on Wednesday. I‚Äôve cheeked to see if my strings are in place and they are. When does this end :(\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: birth control pill causing severe acne??] \n\nHi everyone I‚Äôm new here.. I made a reddit just to join this forum because I am absolutely losing it over my skin right now.ü•¥ I‚Äôve always had the occasional breakout but nothing too severe.. I started taking Enskyce 3 weeks ago and after about a week I started getting pretty bad breakouts. Currently my whole forehead is covered in zits and idk what to do. Has anyone else had this kind of reaction to birth control pills? I was under the impression it would actually improve my skin and I was excited about that but it‚Äôs done the exact opposite clearly.üò≠\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: getting the mirena iud removed today...] \n\nGoing back to the pill I was on. (0.03 mg progesterone)\n\n(I apologize if this is a rambling wall of text. This is my first post in this community, and I'm feeling a little scatter-brained at the moment.)\n\nI've given it over a year to \"level out\", and it's just not working for me. (For what it's worth, I'm 32) The fatigue, the cramping, the mood swings, the developing of persistent hormonal acne (that I had never dealt with while on the pill) is just taking its toll. I've tried changing other areas of my lifestyle before coming to the conclusion that it could be the IUD (saw a nutritionist and changed my diet, I see a personal trainer, I go for massage and acupuncture regularly, and I'm seeking out a new therapist to continue to work on my mental health)  I also work professionally in the area of dermatology, so I'm really very knowledgeable about skin... I went from having completely normal skin with the occasional pimple (who doesn't??) to deep, cystic, painful, and inflamed acne that would erupt on my chin and jawline every few days. Like, three or four massive ones popping up at a time. I eat pretty healthy, drink a lot of water, and the pattern just remains the same.\n\nI think I may be the type of person who's just incredibly sensitive to hormone therapy. I had similar issues with my birth control when I was much younger and on the Patch (what a disaster!) I envy the women that have had success with the Mirena IUD, it definitely has appeal with being so convenient.... But other than the slight annoyance with taking a pill every day, I didn't have any of these issues before switching. \n\nI'm also convinced I feel the thing's presence in my body at all times. I know that sounds silly to say, it's not like I feel like it's migrated (I've had a few ultrasounds over the last year to confirm that it's fine and I haven't developed any cysts) I just have this constant, nauseating feeling that has never gone away since getting it. I believe my doctor thinks I'm overreacting, but I've given it enough time and I just feel like it needs to come out.\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to indulge my ramblings. I'm just overthinking everything right now, and admittedly a little nervous about having it removed this afternoon. I'm about 98% certain that I'm making the right call though.  \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: missed pill and thought i wasn't meant to take two the next day?] \n\nI'm on Levlen ED&gt; For some reason I was under the belief if you miss a pill, you're not meant to 'catch up' but rather take the pill about 12 hours after the one you took when you remember to. So stupid me realised I was 12ish hours late for this pill, took it at about 1am (previously, I normally took it between 12-2pm), then thought I was meant to take the next pill around 12am the next night. I have no idea why I thought this. I remember reading 'do NOT take two pills at once' somewhere on my pill's instructions but can't find it now and am starting to think I completely misread it, because current instructions say to take the pill you missed when you remember, then the next pill at the same time you would the next day- being 12pm. But instead I took the pill at 12am, then 12am the next day, and have been taking it at this time ever since. I had unprotected sex about 2-3 days before I forgot this said pill. I skipped the placebos for the last two packs so hadn't missed a pill for around 40+ days. I had been taking it very on time. Could I be pregnant? Of course I'm freaking out about it now. I feel so uninformed, like I've been taking the pill wrong all this time and didn't even know it!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: can't find bc i can tolerate, planned parenthood is being less than helpful.] \n\nI am 29 years old and have been sexually active for ten years. I've gone to Planned Parenthood the entire time for all my birth control and checkup needs. Over the course of all those years (several of which I was abstinent and not on BC), I've basically run the gauntlet of birth control and had zero or limited success with everything I've tried.\n\nNuvaring (current): weight gain, terrible mood swings, HATE HATE HATE sex\n\nVarious tricyclic oral BC: same as above\n\nParagard IUD: made sex excruciating for me and him both\n\nDepoProvera: gained 60 pounds, hair fell out, attempted suicide\n\nCondoms: extreme bladder and urethra irritation to point of bleeding\n\nI do not under any circumstances trust the withdrawal method and BF would never ever participate. We have been together 5 years and neither have any interest in children.\n\nI've attempted to discuss other options with the nurse practitioner at PP and gotten these responses:\n\nEssure: \"what if your boyfriend leaves and the next guy wants kids?\"\n\nDiaphragm: \"I don't even know where you could find one anymore\"\n\nSponge: \"that's for old women\"\n\nI am literally at the end of my rope. Has anyone had similar experiences where the process of finding BC was torture?\n\nI have insurance. Would I be better off with a private clinic?\n\nI've asked this question in other subs long ago. Mainly I got suggestions to use a dildo or have everything but intercourse. I am not a stranger to toys. I want to cry at the prospect of oral and handjobs until menopause.\n\nHelp!\n\nEdit: should add I suffer from depression and anxiety. Hormonal BC of all types has worsened it considerably.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: crippling periods and compound methods only work] \n\nSo my periods used to put me out of commission for 3 days. I could walk, eat, move, even breathing would hurt. The first day, it wasnt uncommon for me to faint and then vomit from the cramps. To combat that, I went on depo. It helped a lot but the bleeding wouldnt stop and I would have spotting every single day for just over a year after starting. So after talking with my doctor, we also added hormones to combat the bleeding that depo couldnt take care of and the hormones are in the form of The Pill. This is a match made in heaven. I have my body back. My boobs back. My life back. I would miss work and school and have to take trips to the hospital because I was in so much pain. No one ever believed me when I told them how bad it was either, my own psychiatrist didnt believe me untill I fainted in her office. \n\nSo the problem is, I thought I would just keep doing the pill and also depo but now my lady parts doc is telling me we cant keep up with them because theres just too much hormones and it's not healthy. I need to switch up my method but honestly, I am so fucking scared to. This is the first year of my life where I have my control back. I honestly dont even care that it's bad for me, I feel amazing. I feel free. \n\nI have untill january/February to come up with a new method. What are you guys on? My lady parts doc recommended an IUD and I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just dont know how the IUD will be any different from the depo. They're both hormones and the one hormone wasnt enough last time anyway :(  lady's with bad bad bad periods, what is your method for dealing with it? If I could take my uterus out I would, but they said i have to wait untill I'm 26. Share your stories! It will be such a huge help. I had a panic attack last night over this so this is me reaching out I guess.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: problems with expulsion of copper iud, tilted uterus...] \n\nHello, I'm 22 years old and got the copper IUD 3 months ago, the thing is that it got expelled a week after; I went to another gyno and asked to put another one, he did but unintensionally took it off when he turned around to tell the nurse something (very unprofessional, I know), I didn't say anything and he didn't either, just put another (a third) one, it was more painful than the first one and I bled longer too.\nEverything seemed alright for one month until I checked the strings one day and it was almost out... I felt terrible and took it out completely.\nI got another one 3 days ago, because I really don't want to get hormones and the new gyno told me that my uterus was retroverted and that was the cause of it getting expelled, the collocation was the less painful, he was not very careful though. Well, do any of you have a similar experience?, is there anyone who has a retroverted uterus and a IUD?, am I more prone to get it expelled? \nThe whole experience has been really bad and I have wasted much money by now (in my country, you have to pay almost totally for this things) which I don't have since I'm a student...\nthanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i‚Äôm freaking] \n\nMy girlfriend got nexplanon and her nipples were bleeding 6 days afterwards. Is it a side affect or could it be another underlying issue?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: might be freaking out but help] \n\nSo, I had sex for the first time on 3/10 and he used a condom and he said that when he pulled out the condom didn‚Äôt break or anything. The morning after (3/11) we had sex I immediately went to Planned parenthood and got a Plan B, and the Depo shot for birth control. I do have anxiety and tend to think of the worse case scenario, keep that in mind. Well, 3/12 I got my period and everything I think it lasted about a week. I think it was the normal heaviness it always is. Now, a month I‚Äôm not getting my period which I‚Äôve heard is a side effect of the BC, but for some reason my anxiety is spiking and telling me I am pregnant and what if these things didn‚Äôt work etc. Am I just freaking out or should I take a test because I could be pregnant?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: how to transition from pill to no pill? side effects?] \n\nDue to lockdown I cannot buy my usual birth control pills and due to the circumstances, I‚Äôm pretty sure the lockdown won‚Äôt end soon. Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs impossible to get it now (if ever you‚Äôre going to give me advice on how to get it). I‚Äôm planning to go back to my pill when the lockdown ends. \n\nMy question is... are there any bad effects if you stop for a month or two and go back again? Is this recommended? Also, will I still get my regular menstruation once I stop? I am really anxious about this whole thing since I have been using pills since 3 years ago.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: worried ?] \n\nSo I been on my birth control for about a year now and I usually start my placebo pills on Friday. So I been on them for 6 days now and still no bleeding but I did have breakthrough bleeding a week ago, I‚Äôm still taking my placebo pills but I‚Äôm just worried because I‚Äôm not having my period yet or bleeding from it and I don‚Äôt start the active pills again till Friday. Should I be worried ? \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i can feel my cervix but not my iud strings, should i be worried?] \n\nSo as the title says I can‚Äôt feel my strings, I got Kyleena inserted yesterday. I felt the strings once after my shower but can‚Äôt find them again. I would definitely have some bleeding and major cramping if it expelled right?! \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: cramps and discharge on the combination pill] \n\nI've been on Aviane for about a year now and I take it each and every day, on time. I'm on pill 12 in the pack and I have been experiencing a little bit of cramping, slightly sore swollen breasts and slightly increased vaginal discharge, (the consistency is sticky, but more dry than wet, and the color is yellowish/white, which is pretty normal for my discharge on the pill). I think I'm having an irrational fear that I could be pregnant, even though I know it's impossible. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms on the combination pill?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: missed period] \n\nHi guys, I was taking a birth control pill for months &amp; the doctors sent a different one. Seems to have the same ingredients but I can tell it‚Äôs not the one I was previously taking. Anyway, I‚Äôve been on the new one for a month now and my period is no where to be found. I‚Äôm freaking out. Although I‚Äôve been on the pill and the last I had sec was in early May. I‚Äôve had periods since then. But with this one being no where to be found I‚Äôm getting stressed out. Could this be a side effect of changing pills? Should I be worried? I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and am a mess.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: anxiety over side effects developing suddenly] \n\nHi everyone, bear with me because I'm an overly anxious and paranoid person lol. \n\nI was on Aviane from June to mid August, before switching to Lutera. I've currently on my 3rd pack of Lutera right and the last few weeks have given me anxiety more than anything. At the end of my second pack (the placebo week), I didn't experience a \"withdrawal bleed\" per se, but rather just light brown noticeable discharge on day 3/4 with maybe a small drop or two of blood. During this third pack, I experienced two days of breakthrough bleeding which was brown and looked like old blood.\n\nDuring my placebo week, I also broke out in hives on my arms and back that are still here (they look more like acne now, if anything) that didn't go away despite taking zyrtec and applying hydrocortisone and benadryl daily for almost a week. Not sure if this related. \n\nHowever, beginning with this third pack like starting with the very first pill, I've noticed side effects such as breast tenderness, nausea depression/anxiety, bloating, mood swings, and especially hair loss. \n\nDespite being on the same dosage since June, should there be any cause for concern (especially with the very light to non existent period I had last month)? I noticed that since I switched to Lutera, especially the first placebo week/period I had, I had a heavier flow with very excruciating cramps. I had slight nausea/fatigue/breast tenderness when I first switched to Lutera too, but it was so light that it was barely noticeable. \n\nIs this most likely still my body adjusting to the hormones (I've read that it can take up to 6 months for the body to adjust), or should I be concerned? A part of me is somewhat paranoid because I did have sex during my second pack (the one where I got the extremely light period), but we pulled out long before ejaculation and I had took my pills right on time. \n\nThanks, and any help/advice would be greatly appreciated! :)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: iud users: is the worry about the potential risk for expulsion worth it?] \n\nStrongly considering an IUD but worried about it expelling!

And major side effects?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: need ultrasound to get skyla removed] \n\nHi! My Friday has not gone well lol. I got my Skyla inserted three years ago in November, and I have always felt like the poster child of IUDs. Insertion was a breeze (just mild cramping for a bit), never an issue since, and it helped clear up my acne. When I went back to PP for a follow up like a month after, they mentioned the strings were very short but confirmed that they could feel them.\n\nCut to this morning when I went to get my Skyla out and a new one inserted. My gyno said she couldn't feel them, used a little spoolie to try to tease them out with no luck, and said I needed an ultrasound to determine its still in place. She also mentioned that they would numb my cervix when they do pull it out, and that they're gonna stick a little camera up there to help with getting it out. She acted surprised that I wasn't freaking out and commented that she was 'glad I wasn't upset' which made me think - should I be upset?? After that a nurse came in to give me a flu shot (two birds one stone) and also acted like it was kind of a big deal. Has anyone been in this situation and how was the procedure? After a quick google search and reading that the pain is similar to labor I decided I better just ask Reddit.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: boobs hurting after nexplanon] \n\nSo I got the implant a week ago, and my nipples have been so so sore. Is this a common side affect from it? I‚Äôve looked it up but I don‚Äôt see TOO much information on it being a common side effect. \nNot gonna lie, I got a little nervous about it being a pregnancy symptom (I‚Äôm probably just paranoid, I know).\nPlease share your Nexplanon stories with me to set me at ease (:\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: blood clot?] \n\nHey everyone. I‚Äôm really freaking out so I would just like some peace of mind...I‚Äôve had my Paragard for a year and 3 months and everything has been great. I spot mid cycle but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs normal around ovulation. Anyways my cycle is a little irregular but not bad, I can‚Äôt exactly tell when I ovulate because I have ovulation symptoms on and off for about a week around my supposed ‚Äúovulation‚Äù \nMy app said my ovulation was two days ago. But last night I was cramping and it felt *weird* it was more subtle and dull than normal and I usually don‚Äôt have cramping at this time in my cycle especially not dull cramps. It seemed to be more right sided. So I took ibuprofen and it went away but tonight I went pee, and a giant blood clot fell out into the toilet. I‚Äôm trying not to get bad anxiety from it but that‚Äôs never happened to me before ...I‚Äôve had blood clots in my period before but never just mid cycle...I didn‚Äôt have any cramps with it and I wasn‚Äôt bleeding before hand. It was about half the size of my pinky and it was very dark brown/red with some pink in it and it kinda looked like tissue once it was in the toilet. It was so weird. Has anyone experienced this??\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: has anyone experienced *scalp* hair growth when going on bc? which form did you use?] \n\nI'm a little paranoid about potential hair loss when starting a new birth control, but just about every hormonal kind I can research has some people saying that hair loss on the scalp is a common side effect. I've also read more than I care to know about increased hair growth on the face and axilla. I am specifically interested in people who report that their scalp hair has become fuller, thicker, or shows any signs of improvement, after beginning a new regimen of hormonal birth control.\n\nIf you have experienced any of this, my questions are:\n\nDo you have a history of a female- or male-pattern hair loss in your family or yourself?\n\nWhich form of birth control are you using that caused this effect?\n\nIf you did experience fuller scalp hair growth, did you also note increased hair growth on the rest of your body, or the opposite?\n\nThanks guys!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i'm worried my iud is migrating??] \n\nI had my paragard placed \\~9 months ago, and I've always been able to feel the strings since then, even tho I had them cut the strings short. However I've been having a lot of cramping all week that is pretty painful/sharp, and I can't feel the strings anymore. my period is supposed to be in 6 days and I don't usually get cramping this early, so I'm worried that the IUD is migrating??\n\nI am really nervous because I am studying in a country w questionable medical care and I'm not extremely fluent in the language, and I won't be back to the US until mid december\n\nidk if i should go to the doctor for this, or if the IUD was perforating my uterus would the pain be much much more obvious? thanks for any advice\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: cramping few weeks into copper iud] \n\nI had my copper IUD placed about two weeks ago. The insertion was relatively easy and I only had cramping for the first couple of days afterwards. I've continued to have spotting since but wasn't too concerned about that as I'd heard it was somewhat common. I was feeling really good until two days ago. Both Thursday and Friday evening I began to get pretty severe period-like cramping. Last night, it was especially bad on my right side and during the cramps I could feel a really sharp pain in my side. Ibuprofen and a hot water bottle have helped tremendously but the cramping seems to always come back. I can also still feel the strings which gives me peace of mind that I'm likely not dealing with a perforation. \n\nI have heard that the first few months after an IUD can be less-than-comfortable and I'm willing to stick it out if I know this will likely go away in time. I just want to see if it's typical for cramping to come and go weeks after the insertion. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: five negative pregnancy tests] \n\nHello. Just wanted a few opinions on this situation. \n\nI've been dating this girl for a few months, and we have had sex four times. Once in January, twice in Feb, once in March. I've used a condom each time and didn't do anything funny (penetration without condom, ejaculating on her, etc.). She is not on birth control. None of the condoms broke, and I tested each one by filling it with water.\n\nLast month her period was a few days late and very light. Spotting, almost. So I went out and got her a 2 pack of prego tests (EPT). Both neg. She ended up getting a UTI also and was given a urine test at the doc's. Came out neg. \n\nThis month, she complained of oddly-colored discharge. And her period was supposed to come on Sunday. It is currently 4 days late (Thursday right now). She took a digital EPT test on Monday, which came out negative. And ANOTHER test this morning, which came out negative. \n\nSo that's five separate tests that came out negative. I am fairly certain there is nothing to worry about, but I do have some questions. \n\nShe recently began eating more (was pretty underweight when I first met her). Gained ten-ish pounds. Also has began drinking more water. Has been under stress lately (transferring to a university, current school work, tight schedule, late period, etc.). I'm aware that these can all contribute to wonky periods. \n\nShould I take her in to get a blood test next week? She's off to Disneyland this weekend so I can't at the moment. The only thing I can imagine going wrong would be if some sperm leaked out of the base of the condom. It's hard to tell because she gets really wet and when it dries it becomes white. \n\nCan I rest easy? Thanks in advance for any responses. \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: i have bipolar disorder and no one told me about the mirena crash. üôÉ] \n\nI've been experiencing a terrible, uncharacteristically low depression for seemingly no apparent reason that began immediately after my IUD removal. My body was rejecting the IUD so it had to go, sadly.\n\nI have a form of bipolar disorder, but it has always been very manageable for me. I'm not on medication at the moment because I was doing so well off of it (although always willing to go back on it if I needed to). I'm extremely self aware when my symptoms act up, so this has never been an issue.\n\nI admitted on Monday to my boyfriend that I needed to see my doctor and find a medication asap because my depression is so overwhelming out of nowhere. \n\n On a whim I decided to Google IUD removal and depression and came across the dreaded Mirena Crash. I'm so devastated. I had no idea this was possible. I simply wouldn't have risked it and opted for literally any other birth control method, or at least demanded we take precautions to avoid this. I almost feel betrayed, but I guess maybe I'm overreacting on that front. Also my Planned Parenthood physician was definitely aware I have this condition.\n\nI'm going to make an appointment with my Planned Parenthood as well as my primary care doctor as soon as I can.\n\nDoes anyone have advice?

We always use condoms and are extremely paranoid and careful, but this time, probably due to the alchool, we screwed up a bit. I didn't come at any time, but I went inside her without a condom. I thrusted about 10 times and then stopped. She is not on any sort of birth control. I had a bit of pre-cum before, I cleant it on the sheets, but still there may have been precum while I did it or even some may have appeared while I was inside her. \n\nNow, I have been searching about pre-cum and sperm, and wasn't sure what to think. So, this was on the first hours of January 1st. I hadn't orgasmed since at least about December 31st at 00h. So that gives me a 24 - 26 hour margin since the last time I came until I was inside her. Of course I peed a few times in between so that cleant but still.. Her period had ended at the 27th or 28th December, and she's not sure but her cycle seems to be of 30 days. She started her period on the 21st of December. We are both paranoid, can't stop thinking about it and have to wait until it's about the 20's of the month again for her period. \n\nSorry if I made this long, I just want to know how much of a possibility we have that she may get pregnant. Please, help. If this is the wrong subreddit for this, please mods, advise me and tell me where to post. Thank you!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: copper iud scare] \n\nOkay I‚Äôm going to preface this by saying that I have some mild anxiety, and a complete fear of getting pregnant (I once took plan B after a guy fingered me).\n\nAnyways, so I got my second copper IUD on the second of January (my first one expelled after about three months). I just went back to the checkup today, and the gyno told me that she couldn‚Äôt see the strings, and scheduled me for a ultrasound on the 10th. I got my period after the insertion, and since then have had unprotected sex two or three times. I‚Äôm completely paranoid that I could be pregnant (which apparently is one of the reasons the IUD strings go into the uterus), or the IUD fell out again and I didn‚Äôt notice, which could again lead to pregnancy. I took a pregnancy test today which came back as negative, but since my period hasn‚Äôt been due whilst Ive been having sex, the results wouldn‚Äôt be positive even if I was pregnant. I know the best course of action would be to wait till my period comes next week, but problem is - when I‚Äôm stressed, my period can skip or come late (the copper iud also messed with my cycle in the beginning the first time). What‚Äôs the possibility I‚Äôm pregnant?? pls help i‚Äôm dying here \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: bleeding uncontrollably??] \n\nHey all, \n\nI‚Äôm a 19 year old female who just started taking birth control this year (started maybe in April). It‚Äôs only been a few months and luckily it‚Äôs been going pretty good. I take a progestin only pill called norethindrone. Now this is where things get hard to explain. Prior to birth control, if I get a cut on my skin anywhere I wouldn‚Äôt bleed a lot. Maybe a normal amount depending on how deep the cut or scratch on my skin was. But since being on birth control my blood has changed I guess? Two weeks ago my brother had scratched my hand and I was bleeding like crazy from a very small wound. Not to mention my blood seems WAY thicker than usual. The only reason I‚Äôm seriously concerned right now is because of what just happened a few minutes ago. TMI but I had a pimple on my bottom lip and I was messing with it the other day, not intentionally trying to pop it but I ultimately did. This caused a scab and today I picked the scab and was bleeding like CRAZY from a tiny scab. I literally shot blood from my lip. Now here is my question; is this normal? Has anyone else noticed blood changes since taking birth control? I know it causes blood clots which is my biggest concern. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being paranoid or not but I wanna see if this is normal before going to my doctor in a panic. I tried googling this but found nothing. I know this is long so if you actually read this thanks. Please let me know \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: nexplanon removal] \n\nI got my nexplanon out on Monday! Unfortunately the doctor who inserted it put it too deep in my arm so it took almost 30 minutes of pushing and squeezing to get the thing out and MAN I almost threw up lol. My doctor was really nice about it though and said it was the nexplanon from hell lol.\n\nThe important part though is HOW MUCH BETTER I feel after just 4 days without it. I have so much more energy, and my body just feels all around better in every way. Did anyone else not know how zombie like they were on their birth control until after they were off of it? I forgot that I even used to feel like this all the time lol. Anyways I have just been excited and wanted to talk about it somewhere where other people would understand (((:\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: can you crush/chew plan b or dissolve it in water? please help!!] \n\nI have a serious anxiety problem around swallowing pills and  the condom broke last night.

Will taking the pill make any difference or is it just a waste?

That's where i started to freak out and call my doctor but he won't pick up. \n\nSo maybe some of you know, does it interfere with the pill's effect (considering that progestin-only pills are all identical in the strip)? And if not, why do these packages have week&amp;days marks anyway?

I'm coming here for reassurance, mostly, but I'm hoping that someone has had a similar experience?\nUsually I'm pretty late to bleed (periods only really last like three days on this pill which is awesome) but this past month i skipped my period completely (this is the only time i have COMPLETELY skipped). i continued to take my next pack as usual (i'm now on day four) but it is very unsettling to have not bled at all. I took two pregnancy tests on the first day i started a new pack and they both came back negative. I am super responsible with taking my pill so i don't think I'm pregnant, but you know how brains work with second guesses.\nsuggestions, comments, reassurance... anything would be greatly appreciated :) \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: brown spotting with copper iud - is it that common?] \n\nSo, 23 days ago I finally got a copper IUD, and it was all just fine and clean and I was very happy, but yesterday I suddenly felt cramps and noticed like 2-3 drops worth of bright red blood down there, and until now I have to use a panty liner because of brown spotting/smearing. Cramps are almost non-existent today, but I still \"feel\" something on the left lower abdomen side,. It's about 10 days early for my period, so I assume it's a side effect of my IUD. Well, I was warned before about possible brown spotting, but I'm still worried. \n\nShould I now start to panic and visit my gyno asap (I probably don't have enough money but oh well) or does it sound like a common side effect?\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: mini pill stopping period?] \n\ni was on combo pills for two years until they started giving me extreme migraines during the placebo weeks, so my gyno and i decided to switch to the mini pill (i‚Äôm on norethindrone 0.35mg). i‚Äôve been on it since mid-january (started taking it right after my period) and about halfway through that pack I got my period again very early, and haven‚Äôt had one since except for one day of very minor spotting... this kind of stuff freaks me out and my follow up appointment got cancelled due to the pandemic, so i just wanna know if anyone else has had this experience or if i should be worried. thanks in advance:)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: got on bc and i can't stop bleeding! (patch!)] \n\nThis is the first time I've taken BC and it was kind of a rocky start...\n\n\\*\\*\\*Side story\\*\\*\\*\n\nWas going to start on period like suggested (which was late...thanks Chem...) but had an accident with a ripped condom and I completely freaked bc that was the first time I've ripped one and took a morning after and the next day said fuck it and slapped a patch on and here we are. No, I did not mention this to my mother bc shes a big no no for the morning after and ANYTHING to do with abortions (VERY religious Mexican woman).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo anyway, that was fun and I wasn't prego yay! but after I put on the 2nd patch I got my period while on the patch and had no idea what to do. I was going to just not put on another patch after I'd finished off the one I was currently wearing but it ended before I could renew it. Today is the day I change it out and I started bleeding again! Like those thick blood clots, you sometimes get but these are a lot(this was in the last period I had while I was on it). I am trying to set up a virtual doctor's appointment but They can't get me in for a while so I came on here. Any advice? Should I take this one off and not put a new one on? I missed last month's period (I think its bc I put the patch on) and it came the beginning of this month so I don't know if I should take it off for a week for Sept since I technically had one this month already or what. Thank you for listening to my ranting! Any advice would be great!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: possibility of pregnancy?] \n\nHi, I'm currently on birth control pills (Trust, a local brand that's very similar to Nordette, has 21 actives and 7 placebos). My boyfriend and I had sex around the first week of the pack, and again last Saturday (last week of the pack). I take my pills regularly meaning I don't miss days, although not super duper on time. Around 1-10 hrs late.\n\nI'm a bit more concerned about the 2nd time we had sex because I was still taking pills then but it was also close to the end of the pack already. Today, I am on the 3rd day of the 7-day-break (day 24 on pack) and I have not gotten my period yet so I am pretty nervous.\n\nQuestions:\n**How likely is it that I'm pregnant?** and **If it is likely, when is the soonest I can take a pregnancy test?** I am scared that I might get a false-negative. Tests advertise themselves as accurate even a day after the missed period, but in my case it's been less than a week since I last had sex so I don't know just how acccurate it would be if I tried it now.\n\nI'm sorry if this doesn't sound very clear; I can try to clarify, if ever. I'm just kind of a mess right now. Thanks in advance.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: nexplanon implant] \n\nBefore changing over to Nexplanon, I had been on the contraceptive injection for over a year. It was great apart from it made me gain 10lbs and I have Crohn‚Äôs Disease and so had to come off it because of bone concerns.\n\nNow I‚Äôve been on the Nexplanon implant for a year and 3 months but I am suffering with horrendous side-effects. I have developed acne (which I have never had or ever suffered with before) and I have a never ending period. Seriously, I‚Äôve been bleeding constantly from May now and I can‚Äôt go on like this.\n\nI‚Äôve been to doctors and they haven‚Äôt given much advice or help, they‚Äôve just always sent me home but now I‚Äôm getting worried.

I started it about a week after my period and the nurse informed me that I should miss my next one. Unfortunately my period came and it hasn‚Äôt stopped since the 7th. This is driving me insane. I‚Äôm contemplating even getting the second round because I don‚Äôt want this to continue. \n\nMy question is, will this end? So many articles mentioned periods stopping completely and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to have the opposite problem. \n\nBirth control back history- I‚Äôve had the nexplanon and had my period for 6 months straight. They had me take the pill at the same time to try and even it out and it didn‚Äôt help.

I took two pregnancy tests before that and they both came back negative. The last time i had sex was about 3 weeks ago and my bf and I had raw sex for like 15sec and than he put the condom on afterwards. About 2 weeks ago, i became really stressed and depressed over some personal matters and this went on for about a week. After  got my implant, i took another home pregnancy test and that also came back negative. I thought my period started yesterday but it was just some spotting and the blood is completely gone today. My last period started at the end of March and i had no period at all in April. Should i be concerned?

Now she recommended me the copper IUD as I may not take birth controls with hormones (i take antiepileptic drugs and I suffer from a disorder that builds blood clots) \nI‚Äôm a bit afraid to get a copper IUD and I‚Äôd like to hear some experiences (hopefully good ones)!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: prolonged iud cramping?] \n\nHi, I got my Kyleena inserted 11 days ago, and have had mild to severe cramping since. Some days are worse than others. I called the clinic on Friday, but there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do over the long weekend (Canada). Reading some stories on here though is making me think that maybe it‚Äôs not fitting in my uterus properly? They never ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù my uterus like mentioned elsewhere. \nToday is another pretty bad day, and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs connected to all the physical activity I did yesterday, cleaning out the garden. I think I even saw some spotting on the toilet paper earlier. :/\nI checked during my shower last night, and it‚Äôs not poking out, the strings are in place, and I haven‚Äôt had any other signs of possible infection.

I am on birth control, have been since February. I haven‚Äôt even missed on dose so far, I‚Äôve been pretty responsible about it. But, for some reason, I literally feel I cannot trust my birth control. (I‚Äôm on the combination pill). I find myself coming back to this forum very often to ask questions that seem outrageous just for reassurance. I‚Äôm in college; there are people around me having sex, not even on birth control, some using condoms some not. I just don‚Äôt understand how I, someone who avidly uses birth control can be so paranoid just because of a condom slipping at the end or something. All the people around me trust the condoms so well, and many people let guys ejaculate inside them while they‚Äôre on bc! I cannot comprehend that, I would be so paranoid. Why am I unable to trust my birth control?! I know the facts and statistics. I just wanna know if anyone else knows where I‚Äôm coming from!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: anxious about my sprintec pack getting too warm] \n\nUgh, hello again. I have yet another post about worrying about my BC failing. Honestly I'm getting to the last straw when it comes to taking the pill anyway...I really want to get an IUD or Nexplanon that I can't mess up. But anyways.\n\nSo I've just started week two of a pack, however on Saturday, I left my pack in my purse on the seat of my car, where it was in the sun for about 45 minutes to an hour. It wasn't super hot--like mid 60s. But when I took my purse inside and pulled out the pack in a panic, it (the pack) was warm to the touch. Frantic Googling has not really assured me that the remaining pills are effective, but I've been taking them anyway. I'm going to call my pharmacy tomorrow (literally had no time to call today), but can anyone help me feel better about this? I think my husband and I had sex within the last five days (been a crazy busy weekend, so it's hard to remember) so I'm worried that I've now been essentially unprotected since Saturday, and could still become pregnant, which I am so not ready for yet.\n\nReally hoping I'm over-worrying...I just can't afford to get pregnant yet, and for religious reasons I will not pursue emergency contraceptives or an abortion...\n\nP.S. I have crappy Kaiser catastrophic insurance. Does anyone have any experience with getting either an IUD or Nexplanon for free or cheap through Kaiser or another source??\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[TITLE: 13+ years on the pill - considering switching to paragard. positive/negative experiences?] \n\nI've been on birth control pills - mainly Yaz - since I was in high school. I am now 32 and wanting to switch to a copper IUD for various reasons: wanting to be hormone free, lack of libido, vaginal dryness, wondering what the *fudge* my normal cycle is actually like, and possibly wondering if the pill has contributed to my anxiety and depression. I initially went on the pill for acne-related reasons. I know this question is posed a lot, but is the copper IUD really as scary as it sounds? I honestly cannot remember what my natural period is like anymore. After 13+ years on the pill, my periods are almost nonexistent.

Four months ago I went off due to health complications (growths on my cervix related to the pill).\n\nGoing off has been an absolute nightmare! I know it will take time for my body to re-regulate itself, but I'm starting to think it never will. My mood swings have been intense, and when I do get my period the cramps are debilitating. To top it all off, I have acne EVERYWHERE for the first time ever. No amount of OTC or prescription acne medication will touch it. \n\nOverall I just feel gross all the time.

And once again, even though I'd told him to pull out, he came inside of me.\n\nSo i'm wondering if that pill i took protects me against the second time? \n\nYes, i know unprotected sex is an awful idea if you don't want to get pregnant.

I waited the recommended seven days and chose to not have sex until I finished the second week of the pack (starting the third week). I've been taking the pill everyday at the same time, haven't missed any. Haven't taken any meds but Sertraline and Loratadine for allergies (as long as I've been told, they DON'T interact with bc pills) PLUS I've been using condoms, the three times I had sex, to be extra sure.\nThese are my questions (I'm new at this, this is my first month so bare with me please):\n1. Does it make pregnancy more probable the fact that I didnt start the pills the first day of my period and intead started the FIRST SUNDAY after my last period STARTED? (the information that came with the pill listed this as a possibility, but it warns that I should wait 7 days to have unprotected sex, which I DID, I waited two full weeks to have sex)\n2. I'm having terrible brest pain, my breast are bigger, tense and painful at touch. This was common before too, one week prior to my periods they would hurt, BUT NOT THIS MUCH! I've read that this is a common side effect of the pill, but also, this is a common early symptom of pregnancy. I've been experiencing nausea at night, before I go to bed too, which is also associated with pregnancy.\nCan symptoms of pregnancy show this early on? (It's been roughly 9 days since I became sexually active for the first time) Can the nausea be associated with the TIME I take the pill? I take it everyday at 6pm sharp. \n3. What are my chances? I thought birth control pills plus condoms should be super safe.. but I'm in my 4th day of sugar pills and still no sign of blood. Not even a bit. I'm scared. But I don't know if buying a pregnancy test is necessary FOR REAL or not. I don't want to tell my mom about this.¬†\nPlease be kind and patient, I'm a super anxious person, but I've always been regular on my period and this is scaring me. \nI didn't want to post this because even I think all I need is reassurance, but me and my mom aren't close and I'm a first year student in another city far from home, so I don't know anyone here that well. \nANY experience, opinions and advice you guys can provide I'll be grateful for.

I have been shifting to lighter periods that start later in these 2 years, so maybe it's just going to start later, but I cant relax until I see even a bit of pink spotting. Sometimes i consider going on a birth control where i dont get periods, but I will flip out even more. I hate this so much\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n"

Legit. Shoot me before I multiply üòÇ\n-------------------------------------------\nI‚Äôm crampy today so it‚Äôs either my vagina is expelling my IUD, or my IUD has migrated, or I‚Äôm ovulating, or my body‚Äôs just saying fuck you you‚Äôre not allowed to forget you can bear children even if you don‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs a toss up, really.\n-------------------------------------------\naccidentally dropped my birth control pill in the trash yesterday so my mood is fucked to shit lmao\n-------------------------------------------\nheres a summary of how my week is going: my boyfriend tells me he thinks it better if we split, my contracted hours at work are cut, i am told i can't have my iud re-fitted or removed because of the virus, my dad has told me hes coughed up blood, i gained 4lbsüëçüëçüëç\n-------------------------------------------\nWorking half a day today because I woke up with a migraine and period cramps from hell. Getting a iud was a good idea but holy fuck do these cramps hurt üò≠\n-------------------------------------------\nIdk how to ask the medical dude for a contraceptive pill. I heard it helps with cramps.\n-------------------------------------------\nDoes anyone have an IUD? Have y‚Äôall ever couldn‚Äôt find your strings?

To 5 more years without periods or babies ü•Ç\n-------------------------------------------\nJust finished telling my mom how shitty it was that she scared me off getting an IUD when I was a teenager, because this is thoroughly good.\n-------------------------------------------\nmy iud experience has been the absolute fucking worse.\n-------------------------------------------\nI've heard horror stories about the iud perforating, migrating, and doing terrible things. Gonna try to wait it out til tomorrow, bc...\n-------------------------------------------\nStupid fucking IUD is fucking with my hormones and dangerously impacting my mental health. Foolproof birth control versus suicidal urges &gt;.&lt;\n-------------------------------------------\nIt‚Äôs times like these that I‚Äôm grateful I got an IUD months ago and sad that I had to have the foresight that it was something I should do\n-------------------------------------------\nThat IUD really wrecked my shit ü•¥ I‚Äôm hurtingggg\n-------------------------------------------\nTook out the nexplanon and my skin is going back to normal!!

I am so excited. http://bit.ly/oH8ZK3 #infertility #ttc\n-------------------------------------------\nFound out an IUD costs $700. :/\n-------------------------------------------\nWell fucccccccck Implanon is expensive! But it lasts 3 years...upfront cost=less than pills for 3 years. fuck blah.\n-------------------------------------------\nFun fact. After an extended IUD implant replacement procedure (Google says it takes 5 minutes, mine was 35 minutes) booze doesn't stop the cramps 12 hours later. Ya just don't care. *thank u unofficial advice of my gyno who was as emotionally done as I was physically by the end*\n-------------------------------------------\nI'm low key scared of that Nexplanon tho. Anything can say you won't be pregnant for 3-5 years seems it will make you infertile\n-------------------------------------------\n\n"
