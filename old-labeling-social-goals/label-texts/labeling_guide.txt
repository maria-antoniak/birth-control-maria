GENERAL NOTES
- In general, ask yourself what kind of responses the author expects or is trying to receive.
- Take users at their word. If they ask specifically for experiences, then it's not information. If they ask for emotional support, then it's not experiences.
- Pregnancy scare posts are usually both SEEKING INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT and SEEKING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT.
- Don't agonize over the labels; do your best and move quickly; when in doubt, apply both labels.

========================================
REDDIT POSTS 
========================================

SEEKING INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT
- Asking factual questions (how do I…? should I…?)
- Posts asking about which method to use
- Asking about costs, access

PROVIDING INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT
- Educational links, access and cost information, explanations of how birth control works, etc.
- Looking for advice (that doesn't mention looking only for experiences)

SEEKING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
- Rants, lots of emotion in post
- Explicit asks for emotional support ("help me calm down", "help me, I'm freaking out", "looking for reassurance")
- Relationship advice

PROVIDING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
- Reassurance, "it's going to be ok"
- All relationship and interpersonal advice

SEEKING EXPERIENCES
- “Has anyone had experience with…?”
- “Has this happened to anyone else?”
- “Is this normal?”

PROVIDING EXPERIENCES
- Only when the explicit goal of the post is to share; does not include posts that share experiences in order to ask questions

DISCOURSE
- Political commentary 
- Humor, memes, off-topic stories (seeking engagement)
- Often can also be information support; best to label as both if necessary.
