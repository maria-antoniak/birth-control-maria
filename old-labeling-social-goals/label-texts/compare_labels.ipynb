      "So, here’s the deal. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 12. At 14, after being put on the pill to help with the PCOS symptoms, my periods started getting super heavy and lasting for months at a time. To make a long story short, I bled so much that I needed blood transfusions and had to have a D&amp;C to scrape out the contents of my uterus and stop the bleeding. I tried a few different pills and they all resulted in the same thing. I ended up having 3 D&amp;Cs, and during the last one in 2014, they placed in a Mirena IUD while I was in surgery. This really worked at stopping the bleeding and I was free to live a normal life again (Albeit, without a period). \n",

I wanted some time before we start trying to conceive to work out the kinks, figure out if I can have a normal, manageable cycle, and figure out if I actually even ovulate. I scheduled my removal for this Friday, and I have to admit, I’m nervous as hell. Every account I’ve read has either said it was super painful, or that they felt practically nothing. Almost everyone compares it to the insertion though, and because I wasn’t conscious to experience that, I have no point of reference. I’ve tried watching some technical videos to relieve some of my anxiety and nervousness, but it sends me into a full blown panic attack each time I even think about it. I have some PTSD-related issues due to the massive amounts of pain I was in after the surgeries on my uterus, so that’s definitely not helping. Finally, after dozens of OB-GYN appointments, I’m just now able to somewhat tolerate the smallest speculum they have at my office without completely panicking and freaking out. \n",

I had always viewed myself as fairly mentally stable, throughout college and high school/middle school, which to be honest were the rougher years of my life.

      "So, in April I switched from Norgestimate to Jolessa, one of the generic forms of Seasonale. The main reason behind this switch was that I was sold on the idea of only having my period four times a year. (Typically, my periods have always been very, very painful to the point of fainting.) I went off Norgestimate for roughly a month previous to starting Jolessa--I had been taking Norgestimate for just under a year. (Within the first week off the pill, I immediately dropped four pounds of water weight, and my complexion cleared up, yay!)\n",

My emotions were suddenly going haywire, I felt incredibly apathetic/depressed, I felt (and still do) bloated constantly, and although I am very active, I gained nearly ten pounds (and am still trying to lose it). However, I want(ed) to soldier through it, because my first couple of weeks on Norgestimate were not the greatest, either. \n",

I'm nearly finished with week 9 of the pills, and the breakthrough bleeding has not let up whatsoever...at first, it was barely noticeable, and only when I wiped. But the 'flow' has increased from light spotting to what often looks like old, muddy blood, with clumps in it. The 'flow' has been heavier this last week, with the introduction of painful cramps that occur randomly, and I have very little energy--it's like I'm having a regular period, rather than breakthrough bleeding. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do plan to start taking iron pills to help with my energy levels, and while the 'flow' of breakthrough bleeding isn't constantly intense and heavy, it definitely has become increasingly more frequent (and now is painful as well). I'm honestly becoming frightened of taking the last week of pills, which are the white ones--given how painful my actual periods are without birth control, and the amount of sudden, twisting cramps I've been experiencing the last few days, I'm worried I won't be able to function during a withdrawal bleed. \n",

      "From what I've read, this continual amount of bleeding is somewhat common with extended pills, and apparently can sometimes take months to stop.

Used hormonal methods from age 16 to 24, on and off. Had the usual side effects like weight gain (Yaz was AWFUL), depression (very bad on OTC / LO), loss of libido, mood swings, fatigue, and bad bloating. I started getting severe migraines with aura at age 24 from any estrogen-containing methods and stopped all use from then on. For the last 6 years I've relied solely on condoms, sponges, and charting.  At age 24-26 I had several abnormal paps, had 3 colposcopies, and ended the ordeal with a LEEP at age 26.\n",

She had no idea this birth control existed but since she was familiar with the drug she prescribed it for me. Since this type of BC is new in the USA, I thought I would keep a “diary” of how it works for me. I really wanted to see other people’s experiences with this pill before taking it but since it is so new there isn’t much about it. Hopefully this will help someone else out there wanting to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "**About the drug**\n",
      "Slynd is a new birth control pill that has been FDA approved in the United States a few months ago. It is 4mg of drospirenone once daily with a week of inactive pills. It is in fact a progesterone only pill despite being the same ingredient that’s in Yaz. It is the only POP approved for use in the US that allows a 24 hr time frame to take a missed pill. It is also the only POP that has a week of inactive pills.\n",

With past birth control methods I lost my sexual desire completely and experienced severe anxiety. These two reasons were enough to make me want to stop. From 18-21 I was hormone free but since Slynd is new the market I thought I would give it a try.\n",

I do not feel any side effects just yet but I feel as though it is too soon to feel much yet. I do have Chronic Idiopathic Constipation meaning that I can’t have a bowel movement without medication. I take my medication for CIC in the morning and sometimes experience diarrhea with it (sorry if tmi) so I’ve been taking Slynd at night so that it has time to absorb. So far, I have been very good with taking it because I have an alarm set. However, knowing that I have 24 hr time frame if I miss a pill definitely makes me feel better. That’s all I’ve got for now but I will try to update in a week!!\n",

      "I’ve suffered from painful periods since I was a teenager. I’ve been fortunate in the sense that my periods were always super on time and regular. Days 1 and 2 were always hell but days 3-5 were a breeze. Came every month like clockwork and I knew exactly what to expect. Some month the cramping was dreadfully painful to the point I’d have to call out from work because I was so nauseous I was vomiting. I’d been on birth control off and on as a teenager and into my mid 20s. The hormones were always a pain so I’d eventually just stop taking whatever method I was using. \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to get the Mirena IUD in March 2019. I went into it with zero research. My insurance covered Mirena 100%, so I figured that would be the best option. I wanted to stop my periods to avoid the dreaded cramps. \n",
      "\n",
      "On insertion day, it took my doctor THREE tries to insert it. Some of the worst pain I’ve felt in my life. So painful I was in tears (and I have a fairly high pain tolerance). However, once it was in place, I felt normal. She told me I’d probably experience some cramping and bleeding over the first week or two before my periods gradually stopped. Day one was hell, I bled heavily and the cramps had my hanging over a toilet. Beyond that, the Mirena was amazing. My periods stopped after the first week on it. I experienced occasional spotting and cramping over the first year. I was so happy to be pain free! Not to mention saving lots of money on sanitary products monthly. But this all changed... \n",
      "\n",
      "In April of this year, I started noticing these changes: \n",
      "1. I started experiencing IBS symptoms. Bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, discomfort and cramping. My diet never changed once and I’m not intolerant to foods. \n",
      "2. Hair started thinning out. Noticed more breakage than usual. Hard to brush my hair when I’d never had issues before. I would run my fingers through my hair and come out with a handful of strands. \n",
      "3. Intense, debilitating cramping in the early morning a few times a month. Would wake up around 3am and be in constant agony until around 6am when they’d stop. Heating pad helped a bit but not always. Tylenol or other painkillers did nothing. No triggers (foods, stress, etc) I could correlate with these episodes. \n",
      "4. Increase in feeling constantly anxious/depressed. Always had slight anxiety but nothing to the extent it has become.\n",
      "5. Ovarian cysts showed up on an ultrasound. Never ever dealt with these before (to my knowledge). \n",
      "\n",
      "This has been happening since April/May. I wasn’t too alarmed until the intense cramping started. I messaged my doctor and she scheduled me for a transvaginal ultrasound, concerned my IUD might have migrated. The ultrasound discovered a few cysts that, as far as I know, I’d never had before. She recommended putting me on an oral pill to help the pain and hope it would go away. A few weeks post the cyst discovery, I was having debilitating cramps at work. I felt a gust of blood (alarming since I hadn’t bled in a year and a half). I went to the restroom and cleaned myself up. The pain persisted for about another hour and completely dissipated. My bleeding stopped and I assumed this was the cyst bursting. For another week, I felt great. No cramping. Only for it to return one night. I’ve been cramping on and off ever since then. I made the decision on August 27th to schedule an appointment to remove my Mirena. \n",
      "\n",
      "On September 9th, I went in and got my Mirena removed. I was worried and anxious about it, believing it would hurt just as bad as having it placed. I was relieved when she was able to gently remove it with no problems. I experienced a bit of cramping as she pulled it out but it disappeared after about 5 minutes. I’ve experienced light spotting for about an hour afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although it’s been not even 48 hours since removal, I feel like a different person. I haven’t felt a single cramp since removal and I’m overjoyed. No bleeding or discomfort. I feel less bloated and am having more regular bowel movements. I’m not as anxious or irritable. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m unsure what I plan to do for birth control in the future. Might go back to the pill since they’ve had the least side effects. And although I’m dreading my first period in a year (when it comes), I’d rather experience it and never go back to Mirena ever again. Atleast with a painful period, I know what to expect.

With her mood being off she never wants to be intimate either when we were constantly “fooling around” multiple times a week before the implant. I have taken her on many dates since the implant and try and get out to have as much fun as possible since to boost her mood it seems like nothing I do works. She isn’t constantly depressed but every couple weeks she will have a 3-4 day span when she just can’t stop herself crying I try to be there for her as much as possible but I’m running out of ideas. Has anyone else experienced this with the nexplanon or have any tips/ideas? It’s so hard to see her like this, I tried to have the conversation on getting it removed but it didn’t go over well. She also admits to the birth control messing with her body. Through research on the internet this seems to be a side effect for the implant but I’m looking for suggestion from someone who went through it. Thanks in advance\n",

I still HIGHLY recommend this method to anyone who will listen, even tho it did fail for me, twice. The lesson to be taken out of this experience is this: if you know something is wrong, don’t listen to someone who tells you otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get into it. It’s going to be long. I have been on many many types of birth control. To name the first few I started when I was 13? Mini pill, pill, Nuvaring, Skyla, mirena, depo shot but pill form, and now the nexplanon. 7 forms. And I’m now only 18. I’m gonna start by saying, you’ve probably guessed, but I didn’t use BC as a pregnancy preventative. I used it like a medication. I’m gonna go into detail about my first IUD. I got the Skyla put it by my primary care doctor and it was painful. I will not lie, it’s painful. But I have a very high pain tolerance and bit through the pain. About 2 months having the IUD put in, I knew something wasn’t right. I was about 14 at the time, and I knew something wasn’t right because the strings were protruding out of my vagina. Yes. Those short strings that are supposed to stay up tucked by the cervix were in fact, now poking right out of my entrance. I called up my Gyno and they got me in and they took a look and said, nope you’re fine BUT just in case. Let’s take a look via ultrasound. They did and now and behold, my iud was in the process of just. Shimmeying it’s way right out of my nether regions. It was sitting very low in the uterus and embedded itself right at the opening. Gyno took one look at it was like “ooooo shit. That’s coming out right. Now.” So they pull those abnormally large strings and say “well. Let’s get you a mirena!” Cool! I get the mirena put in same day and everything looks good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward three years. I’m now sexually actively and I’m LOVING the convenience of the mirena. But it’s not doing it for me anymore. My periods are still heavy and I’m still in mass amounts of pain every damn cycle and I can’t live my life like that. So I go back to the Gyno and they agree, so they double me up. I then start taking medroxyprogestragoneacetate or something. Fancy talk for the depo shot but pill form. And then it just goes downhill. I notice my first period on the pill is Easy and light. Brown blood for 3 days and I’m done. I stop bleeding for like 4 days and then. It’s back. And I think, “huh. Odd”. And it’s actually blood. And then I go out of town for two weeks. And it’s getting increasingly worse and they said it was supposed to stop my bleeding? Not make it worse? So I call my Gyno and get forwarded to a nurse who said “oh it’s fine. You’re good. I’ll talk to the Gyno for you but you’re fine.” And I don’t believe her. I wait 3 more days (still on vacation) and I tell the nurse this time something is wrong, and I’m doubling up and taking two pills a day. And she says “okay. Whatever. You still don’t need to talk to the Gyno. You’re fine. See you whenever” and hangs up. So I get back from vacation,now loading a lot of hormone into my body and I just have this feeling. Something not right. This isn’t normal. After the 4 weeks of bleeding I get worried. This isn’t supposed to happen. And I check my strings one day in the shower and lo and behold, I feel a hard nub. I have my boyfriend feel my hard nub. I feel the hard nub 20 more times to make sure. That hard nub is my iud falling out. So the first thing I do is I take my ass right back to a different Gyno and have her look for .2 seconds and tell me “nope. I don’t see it. You’re fine”. But!! Tell me that the new birth control I was taking shouldn’t be making me bleed. And send me on my way. I payed $75 bucks to have her tell me I’m wrong? And come back in 2 weeks and have an ultrasound down? And if I’m worried, to not have sex, what is this? This isn’t birth control, this is my medication and it’s falling out of me! I need help! But I have to wait 3 more days because of the New Years. And then I call my Gyno up like “hey. This is the deal. What can y’all do for me” and they say “oh haha just don’t have sex, and come in 3 WEEKS!!!! From now. We will get you in for an ULTRASOUND to check!” No. Absolutely not. I already had one doctor tell me to wait. I had a nurse write me off as dramatic over the phone. I know I’m right and I need the help now. I’ve been bleeding at this point for over a month and a half. What’s going on. So I over exaggerate a bit and say that it’s causing a lot of pain and I need it removed. Oh! What’s this? An appointment in 20 minutes! That just randomly popped up outta nowhere!! Lemme get you in. So I hop in my car, strut right up to that appointment and I tell them my problems. Now the Gyno is a little “eh”. But against her wishes, checks. And what does she find?\n",

      "So I've lurked here for quite some time and thought I should post about my experience with going off BC and getting the copper IUD!\n",
      "\n",
      "   About a month or so ago I decided that after 7 straight years of being on birth control pills that it was time to try the hormone free life for a while. I was pretty nervous since I had been on the pill for so long and I didn't know how my body would react. That being said, I have nothing but positive things to say about going off the pill! I know this might sound strange but I feel more womanly, more in tune with myself and my body, and almost like a fog has been lifted. My self confidence for whatever reason has also gone up as well as an insane increase in libido. My orgasms have also been more intense which I did not expect at all. I haven't noticed any changes with my weight, boobs, or skin though I expected a decline in all of them lol. That's pretty much all I can think of thus far in regards to the pill.\n",
      "\n",
      "   \n",
      "The reason I wanted to try the Paragard IUD was not only because it's hormone free, but also because I knew my bf and I would most likely still not use condoms. AKA I'm not looking to get pregnant any time soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, here's my experience with the IUD!\n",
      "\n",
      "***The insertion: Whole process took about 20 minutes. Measuring the depth of the uterus was way more uncomfortable and unpleasant than I expected, but it was quick. The doctor also sprayed my cervix with some numbing agent which burned and felt super weird. To be honest, I don't know if it helped much for the actual insertion, hard to tell since I have nothing to compare it to. The insertion of the actual IUD was very painful; it was like a sharp, extremely intense period cramp that lasted until the insertion was over which thankfully was only about 6-10 seconds. I did some (what I imagine to be like) pregnancy breathing, and mild swearing if that helps paint you a better picture. \n",
      "\n",
      "   Once the procedure was over, the doctor did an ultrasound to check the placement and make sure everything was in order. I thought this would be from my pelvic area but nope, another probe into my vagina--thankfully the last one for the appointment. I had some period like cramping for the rest of the day, but was able to go to work right after with no problems. I pretty much cramped and spotted on and off for about 2 weeks. There was also a decent amount of mucus like discharge, since the walls of the uterus are being thickened with such. \n",
      "\n",
      "   This past weekend I got my first period since going off BC *and* getting the IUD and not gonna lie, its been a real doozy. The cramps during the first few days were insane even with loads of ibuprofen, tylenol, aleve, and such. I was practically crushing my boyfriend's hand when we were driving on Saturday. I thought my cramps before were annoying and unpleasant, but these ones are simply brutal and I seriously took my cramps before for granted. My flow has also increased dramatically. When I was on BC, I could usually keep in a super tampon for about 8 hours without any problems. However on Monday, I bled through a super tampon, a pad, through my underwear, and on to my jeans in less than 4 hours. So that fucking blows. \n",
      "\n",
      "   That being said, I can handle the cramps for the most part and I can deal with the bleeding. The mental security in pregnancy prevention and the benefits I've experienced with going off the pill definitely make the shitty periods worth it. I'm still on my period now so I can't speak to the duration, but I'm hoping it doesn't last longer than 7 days! *Fingers crossed*\n",
      "\n",
      "**In case anyone is curious or finds this helpful I'm 21 and have never been pregnant. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; Went off BC for the first time after 7 years--feeling fucking great. Sex drive up, confidence up, fog has been lifted. IUD hurts like a bitch to get put in, but it was tolerable and shouldn't deter you. Periods really suck now, but I can deal.  \n",

When I did have periods, they were normal and pain-free, but I would have 2-3 or so in a 1 or 2 month span, then it would skip for 10 more months. I had still never been on BC ever at this point.   \n",
      "\n",
      "I went to the doctor who sent me in for ultrasounds to look for PCOS, and I had blood work done to test my hormone levels. Ultrasounds came back normal and my uterine lining was normal; so it wasn't just continuously building up. My hormone levels also appeared normal, although my testosterone was in the upper levels of the normal range for females. I was told that I was most likely not even ovulating, and that this isn't a bad thing, although not good if I wanted to have children in the future (which I do not).  \n",
      "\n",
      "My doctor gave me tons and tons of samples of the pill (Loestrin 24 I believe) to try. The pill did not treat me right. I used it for 5 months and still did not have normal periods - they came too early, lasted longer, and were heavier. Eventually I gave up and went back to my natural period-free state because the doctor's weren't concerned about it.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Skip forward to age 23, I went back to a different doctor to get BC as I had a steady boyfriend. The doctor put me on the pill. Same one, Loestrin 24. It was terrible. I took that pill at the same time everyday, but I always started my period halfway through the pack, it lasted until I started the next pack, and I experienced cramping, which is something I've never had before in my life. I gave it 6 months and stopped taking it. I happily went back to skipping periods for 10 months. I have been with this bf for 3 years now with no true pregnancy scares; I do take a pregnancy test every few months just to make sure.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Now at 26 things are changing again. It is April, and I have had nearly regular periods since December. They are more frequent than the normal 28 day cycle; I have about 2 a month. I've been waiting for them to stop and go back to my 10 month no period thing, but that hasn't happened yet. I'm sexually active and we do not use protection (we were both tested early in the relationship for STDs and have been together exclusively with no problems), but now I believe pregnancy could be a legitimate thing, so I want to fix that. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I will NOT do the pill. I have been considering an IUD, but I'm not sure if I want to get Skyla or Mirena, which both release a progestin hormone, and I'm afraid that will somehow make me have monthly periods. They are advertised as eventually eliminating periods altogether in many women, but my cycle has never been a conformist. Yes, my periods have returned, but I fully believe they will stop again in a few months, or at least that's what I'm betting on. So that also leaves Paragard, which is hormone free, but I've read about complications. It's not advertised for women who have not had children, but it is supposedly safe for them. Can anyone give me any options or advice? I have an appointment with my doctor later this month, and I would like to have a full list of questions and ideas for her, so I can make the best choice for my child-free (and hopefully period-free) lifestyle. \n",

I decided to go to student health at my school and talk to a professional there to switch brands. She switched me the same day and I began on Sprintec. I have not experienced any problems with it so far from the depression/anxiety aspect at all. The only thing is that my periods are very heavy on this brand and I get bad cramps, which is kinda annoying since easing those symptoms was part of the reason I liked the idea of birth control to begin with (aside from safe sex).

My girlfriend was on her period last week, and during her period week - I'm sure you guys are all aware she takes \"sugar pills\" instead of the BC - to keep her in the habit of taking the pills and taking hormones with no break can eliminate your period completely after awhile (may need a fact check on this). Anyways - Sunday was the first day she was back on her Birth Control - not the placebo pill. We had sex with no protection (we try but we hate using condoms) - and in the heat of the moment I accidentally came in her a little bit. At first she wasn't worried - but the Monday she told me that we should possibly buy a pregnancy test because BC is not as effective the first day coming back after a period. Is this true? I've been having sex for the past 7 years and I've never heard this before. I know that BC is only 99.9% effective - but should we be worrying about what happened? I should 1000% relearn fully how ovulation works, but in the meantime anyone can let me know if BC isn't as effective on the first day after the placebo pills - that would be much appreciated to know!\n",

      "I got my paragard in a little less than a month ago. From the two string checks I did, I really had to reach up inside of myself to feel them. (note: the last time I checked my strings before this was at least a week ago) I started my first period with it last Friday. Yesterday, my tampon was causing pain so I pulled it out to replace it with a smaller one. When I did so, it felt kind of odd, like it was pulling on something. Then last night I decided to check my strings and I could literally feel them right at the opening of my vagina. I didn't feel any discomfort from my tampon today, but when I took it out I could literally feel the strings hanging just out of the tip of my vagina. Do you think that this is expulsion or has my cervix really just dropped super low?? I know I have to see my doctor to make sure, just looking for some reassurance or similar experiences.                   [Update] it had moved down! Went to the doctor today and had it replaced. Please ladies, take this as a warning to always trust your intuition if you're worried something isn't right with your body!\n",

      "I was thinking the same, honestly. I've heard that the main mechanism of action of the implant is preventing ovulation, but then it also thickens the cervical mucus and thins the uterine lining - so basically there's three ways it prevents pregnancy - prevents the release of an egg, prevents sperm from getting in the uterus, and prevents the zygote from implanting, if anything else fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I found [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11246602):\n",
      "&gt;Implanon inhibits ovulation by preventing the mid-cycle luteinizing hormone peak. Although it initially suppresses follicular development and estradiol production, ovarian activity slowly increases after 6 months, and follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels are almost normal. Endogenous progesterone levels remain in the subovulatory range for &gt; 3 years in most subjects. In ovarian ultrasound studies, ovulation occurred in &lt; 5% of users after 30 months of use. \n",

      "[This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13195166_The_pharmacodynamics_and_efficacy_of_Implanon_R_-_An_overview_of_the_data) might be a good read as well.\n",
      "&gt;This *(pregnancy prevention)* was achieved by inhibition of ovulation, which was reflected by suppressed P levels, as the primary mode of action. Ovulation was inhibited, but otherwise ovarian activity was still present (follicle growth, E2 synthesis). The FSH serum concentrations were only slightly lower than preinsertion levels **and LH surges were prevented**. \n",

Reason why I want it is obviously for pregnancy prevention but also because I really don't do well with hormones considering I have a history of anxiety and depression and am medicated for it. I've been using a diaphragm while I've been with my boyfriend of 6 months but it's been giving me so many UTIs, yeast infections, etc. it's getting ridiculous. I'm pretty sure I have a yeast infection right now as I'm typing this. But so the Paragard is probably what I'm leaning towards the most, but I am a little concerned about the side effects. I know periods tend to get longer and heavier which is something that won't be fun, but I can deal with because my periods are pretty short and moderate as it is. The one thing I'm concerned about though is cramps as you said they do get worse. I know it's not like a walk in the park and it's different for everyone, but would you say the increase in cramps interfered with your daily life? Because that's one thing that I really can't have happen to me considering I lead a pretty active life.

Ultrasounds can show you almost immediately if the lump is a cyst, enlarged lymph node, irritated sweat gland, or something which needs further evaluation. If it looks like a cyst, you can even ask them to aspirate and test it to be sure. \n",

It used to be painful for a few days once a month but now that I've had the Mirena for over 2 years, it's rarely painful anymore since I don't seem to have a cycle anymore.
