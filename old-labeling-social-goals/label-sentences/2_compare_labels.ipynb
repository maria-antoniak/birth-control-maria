It has been awesome lol.\\n\\nMy one concern is if I\\'m reducing its effectiveness. Intuitively it seems like it would not effect it at all (similar to taking back-to-back oral contraceptive), but I was wondering if anyone here has a definitive answer on this. \\n\\nI\\'ve lurked here a while - this really is a great resource.

      "I was thinking the same, honestly. I've heard that the main mechanism of action of the implant is preventing ovulation, but then it also thickens the cervical mucus and thins the uterine lining - so basically there's three ways it prevents pregnancy - prevents the release of an egg, prevents sperm from getting in the uterus, and prevents the zygote from implanting, if anything else fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I found [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11246602):\n",
      "&gt;Implanon inhibits ovulation by preventing the mid-cycle luteinizing hormone peak. Although it initially suppresses follicular development and estradiol production, ovarian activity slowly increases after 6 months, and follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels are almost normal. Endogenous progesterone levels remain in the subovulatory range for &gt; 3 years in most subjects. In ovarian ultrasound studies, ovulation occurred in &lt; 5% of users after 30 months of use. \n",

      "[This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13195166_The_pharmacodynamics_and_efficacy_of_Implanon_R_-_An_overview_of_the_data) might be a good read as well.\n",
      "&gt;This *(pregnancy prevention)* was achieved by inhibition of ovulation, which was reflected by suppressed P levels, as the primary mode of action. Ovulation was inhibited, but otherwise ovarian activity was still present (follicle growth, E2 synthesis). The FSH serum concentrations were only slightly lower than preinsertion levels **and LH surges were prevented**. \n",

      "I actually am really grateful that you posted this because I was just about to ask about the Paragard myself. Reason why I want it is obviously for pregnancy prevention but also because I really don't do well with hormones considering I have a history of anxiety and depression and am medicated for it. I've been using a diaphragm while I've been with my boyfriend of 6 months but it's been giving me so many UTIs, yeast infections, etc. it's getting ridiculous. I'm pretty sure I have a yeast infection right now as I'm typing this. But so the Paragard is probably what I'm leaning towards the most, but I am a little concerned about the side effects. I know periods tend to get longer and heavier which is something that won't be fun, but I can deal with because my periods are pretty short and moderate as it is. The one thing I'm concerned about though is cramps as you said they do get worse. I know it's not like a walk in the park and it's different for everyone, but would you say the increase in cramps interfered with your daily life? Because that's one thing that I really can't have happen to me considering I lead a pretty active life. If it's just a little pain that can be solved with some Advil that's fine, but is it like excruciating? Let me know! Thank you again!\n",

My GP said that the first few months would be rocky, especially as this is my first time on bc, but I feel the same way - do I wait it out in the hope of improvement, having to deal with low mood all the time? I think if your mood swings are really affecting your lifestyle, and it’s affecting you to a great extent, then it’s worth discussing other methods with your doctor/gynaecologist. I once had to take a day off university because I was so down. If it’s having that sort of affect on your life, you might want to ask for other methods?

She did not say there's zero percent chance, just that because the lower hormone levels localized to the uterus it was likely it wouldn't make my depression any worse.

Even when the pill is used 100% perfectly, which it almost never is, it is not 100% effective.
