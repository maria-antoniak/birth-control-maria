      " i was late 20s, married, no kids and i wanted to find a more permanent birth control method. so i started researching what the procedure \"tying your tubes\" entailed / read a ton of experiences after my paragard partially expelled at one year. i decided on a tubal ligation with filshie clips. it has the best effective rate i could find (lifetime average effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24560346/?i=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;from=filshie%20clips) so i scheduled an appointment with my obgyn, she is on the younger side and very openminded (there is a link in the sidebar to open minded doctors if you don't have a open minded obgyn). we had a 30 minute conversation and she agreed that i was well researched / she was comfortable i understood it was permanent. after the consult, i discussed with her scheduling nurse when i would prefer to schedule it (it was around 3 months out). cost: during my research, i triple checked the aca law required the insurance to 100% cover it. i paid about $10 for the at home pain pills. so in *total* it cost me only $10.00! check out www.coverher.org for info about that! pre-op: since it was scheduled 3 months after the consult the hospital required my doctor to do a pre-op with me. so week of procedure i had a pre-op apt with my doctor. basically just a quick check of everything. i asked whether i needed a catheter and she doubted i would. she gave no restrictions as to sex or exercise and just resume when comfortable. got my pain prescriptions and pre-filled them so i could go straight home after my tubal ligation. definitely ask to get them pre-filled. procedure: it was scheduled for 8:00 am on friday. hospital told me to check in at 6-6:15 am for paperwork / prep. paperwork was just double checking everything (copy of insurance card / etc). walked to a private mini hospital room and nurse started intake / asking health questions (when did i eat last, what medications/ etc) and changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. doctor also stopped by to chat before. i told the anesthesiologist that i get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. then one of the nurses gave me an iv (they numb the area first). i peed right before so i wouldnâ€™t need a catheter (and i didnâ€™t). the nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent ----------blood clot----------s (this is normal for any procedure). around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the iv. later i was then rolled into the or. i don't even really remember leaving the room - they have some good drugs :) post-op: i woke up wide awake in the recovery area. the patch worked so i was not nauseous. the nurse asked my pain scale and i was at a 3/10. it was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real â€˜painâ€™ per se. the doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. she made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). the second small incision is below my bikini line. she then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. after 30 minutes or so i was moved into the big recovery area. the nurse brought me food and juice. my husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal i was. after 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, i got dressed by myself and left. we left around 10:00 am. tips: wear loose fitting pjs and a thin maxi pad. bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore. have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. at-home recovery: friday: i went home and slept. i could walk around fine, i was just tired. i walked up the stairs to my bedroom by myself. my tummy was a tiny bit inflated by the gas they use to see what they are doing in there, but nothing crazy, it just looked like i had eaten a big meal / slight bloat. the pain pills made more tired so i just slept the rest of the day. i late lunch and dinner normally. saturday and sunday: the rest of the weekend, i just watched tv with my husband. i could do stuff, i just chose to relax. basically it was just a lazy weekend. have some good movies and shows to watch. i was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. i could have done errands if i needed to, but with the pain pills you aren't suppose to drive. monday: i went back to work on monday. no prescription pain pills and just did over the counter stuff monday and tuesday. no one even guessed anything :) the worst thing was really from the iv (big bruise as my veins hate ivs) but just wore long sleeve shirts for a few days. tips: heating pad for tummy and popsicles for your throat. summary: it was way simpler and easier than i thought! i have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that faded. the tubal ligation was the best thing i ever did! p.s. don't fall for the fake \"post tubal ligation syndrome.\" the 'doctor' that created it, lost her license (http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/hufnagel/order_2004.shtml or http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1230512.html) for being crazy. neither a tubal ligation (tubes tied), bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal), nor essure (blocking your tubes) will effect your hormones. women usually stop hormonal birth control when they get their tubes tied. as in they return to their natural period. hormonal birth stops your cycle so you neither ovulate nor have a period so when you are on it you have a lighter fake bleed. correlation is not causation. some of the research disproving the fake syndrome - they didn't even find correlation, let alone causation: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7982548 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11106717 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15865627 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071889 why? because it can't /won't restrict the blood flow after surgery. this explains it quite well... https://www.google.com/amp/s/drjengunter.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/tubal-ligation-does-not-cause-early-menopause-beware-the-hormone-experts/amp/?client=safari\n",
